# Chapter Fifteen

## [15.2 Udāyin](../thag15.2/)

A human being, self-awakened,\
his mind tamed, concentrated,\
traveling along the Brahmā road,\
delighting in the stilling of the mind:\
He, having gone beyond all dhammas,\
to whom human beings pay homage,\
the devas pay homage as well—\
so I have heard from the Worthy One\
—to him, gone past all fetters,\
gone from the forest to the clearing,\
delighting in the renunciation of sensuality,\
released like gold from its ore.\
He, the nāga outshining all others,\
as the Himalayas, rocky hills:\
Among all things named nāga,\
he, unexcelled, is truly named.\
I will praise the nāga to you—\
for he does no misdeed.\
Composure & harmlessness\
are the nāga’s two feet.\
Austerity & celibacy\
are the nāga’s two other feet.\
Conviction is the great nāga’s trunk,\
his hand;\
equanimity, his white tusks.\
Mindfulness his neck; his head:\
discernment,\
discrimination,\
reflection on dhammas;\
Dhamma the balanced heat of his digestion;\
seclusion his tail.\
He, in jhāna, delighting in assurance,\
inwardly well-concentrated,\
the nāga, when going, is concentrated,\
when standing, the nāga is concentrated,\
when reclining, the nāga is concentrated,\
when sitting, the nāga is concentrated.\
Everywhere he’s restrained, the nāga:\
That is the nāga’s consummation.\
He eats what is blameless;\
doesn’t eat what is not;\
on gaining food & clothing,\
doesn’t store it up.\
Having cut all bonds,\
fetters tiny & large,\
wherever he goes,\
he goes without longing.\
Like a white lotus, born & growing in the water,\
but not smeared by the water\
—fragrant, delightful—\
even so the awakened one,\
well-born in the world, lives in the world,\
but is not smeared by the world,\
like the lotus, by the water.\
A great blazing fire\
unnourished grows calm,\
and though its embers exist\
is described as unbound:\
Conveying an instructive meaning,\
this image is taught by the observant.\
Great nāgas will recognize\
the nāga as taught by the nāga\
as free from passion,\
free from aversion,\
free from delusion,\
effluent-free.\
His body discarded, the nāga\
will, without effluent,\
totally unbind.
