# Chapter One

## [1.1 Subhūti](../thag1.1/)

My hut is roofed, comfortable,  
free of drafts;  
my mind, well-centered,  
released.  
I remain ardent.  
So, rain-deva.  
Go ahead & rain.

## [1.2 Mahākoṭṭhita](../thag1.2/)

Calmed, restrained,  
giving counsel unruffled,  
he shakes off evil qualities—  
as the breeze,  
a leaf from a tree.

## [1.3 Kaṅkhā](../thag1.3/)

See this:  
the discernment  
of the Tathāgatas,  
like a fire ablaze in the night,  
giving light, giving eyes,  
to those who come,  
subduing their doubt.

## [1.6 Dabba](../thag1.6/)

Whoever,  
hard to tame,  
has been tamed by taming,  
—capable, contented,  
crossed over doubt,  
victorious, as his fears  
are dispersed:  
He is capable,  
unbound,  
steadfast in mind.

## [1.7 Bhalliya](../thag1.7/)

Who scatters the troops
of the King of Death—
as a great flood,
a very weak bridge made of reeds—
is victorious,
for his fears are dispersed.
He’s tamed,
unbound,
steadfast in mind.

## [1.10 Puṇṇamāsa](../thag1.10/)

Whoever,  
a master of knowing,  
contented,[^1]  
restrained in mind,  
destroys longing for here & beyond,  
unsmeared with regard to all dhammas,  
would know the arising-&-disbanding  
of the world.

## [1.13 Vanavaccha](../thag1.13/)

The color of blue-dark clouds,  
glistening,  
cooled with the waters  
of clear-flowing streams  
covered with ladybugs:  
Those rocky crags  
refresh me.

## [1.14 Vanavaccha’s pupil](../thag1.14/)

My preceptor said to me:  
Let’s go from here, Sīvaka.  
My body stays in the village;  
my mind has gone to the wilds.  
Even though lying down,  
I go.  
There’s no tying down  
one who knows.

## [1.16 Belaṭṭhasīsa](../thag1.16/)

Just as a fine thoroughbred steed,  
with swishing tail & mane  
runs with next-to-no effort,  
so my days & nights  
run with next-to-no effort  
now that I’ve gained a pleasure  
not of the flesh.[^1]

## [1.18 Siṅgālapitar](../thag1.18/)

There was an heir to the One Awakened,  
a monk in the Bhesakaḷā forest,  
who suffused this whole earth  
with the perception of  
“bones.”  
Quickly, I’d say, he abandoned  
sensual passion.

## [1.21 Nigrodha](../thag1.21/)

I’m not afraid  
of danger,  
of fear.  
Our Teacher’s adept  
in the deathless.  
Where danger, where fear  
do not remain:  
That’s the path  
by which the monks go.

## [1.22 Cittaka](../thag1.22/)

Peacocks,  
crested, blue, with gorgeous necks,  
cry out  
in the Kāraṁvī woods,  
thrilled by the cold wind.  
They awaken the sleeper  
to meditate.

## [1.23 Gosāla](../thag1.23/)

I—having eaten honey-rice  
in a bamboo patch  
and rightly grasping the aggregates’[^1]  
arising-disbanding—  
will return to the hillside, intent  
on seclusion.

## [1.25 Nandiya](../thag1.25/)

Like splendor, his mind,  
continually fruitful:  
Attack a monk like that,  
you Dark One,  
and you’ll fall  
into pain.

## [1.26 Abhaya](../thag1.26/)

Hearing the well-spoken words  
of the Awakened One,  
Kinsman of the Sun,  
I pierced what is subtle—  
as if, with an arrow,  
the tip of a horse-tail hair.

## [1.29 Hārita](../thag1.29/)

Hārita,  
raise yourself up-  
right  
and, straightening your mind  
—like a fletcher, an arrow—  
shatter ignorance  
to bits.

## [1.31 Gahuratīriya](../thag1.31/)

Touched by gnats & mosquitoes,  
in the wilds, the great forest,  
like a nāga elephant  
at the head of a battle,  
mindful,  
he acquiesces to that.

## [1.32 Suppiya](../thag1.32/)

I’ll make a trade:  
aging for the ageless,  
burning for the unbound—  
the highest peace,  
the unexcelled rest  
from the yoke.

## [1.33 Sopāka](../thag1.33/)

Just as one would be good  
to one’s dear only child,  
one should be good to all creatures  
everywhere.[^1]

## [1.39 Tissa](../thag1.39/)

As if struck by a sword,  
as if his head were on fire,  
a monk should live the wandering life  
—mindful—  
for the abandoning of sensual passion.

## [1.41 Sirivaḍḍha](../thag1.41/)

Lightning lands on the cleft
between Vebhāra & Paṇḍava,[^1]
but,
having gone to the cleft in the mountains,
he’s absorbed in jhāna[^2]—the son
of the one without compare,
the one who is Such.[^3]

## [1.43 Sumaṅgala](../thag1.43/)

So freed! So freed!  
So thoroughly freed am I  
from three crooked things:  
my sickles, my shovels, my plows.  
Even if they were here,  
right here,  
I’d be done with them,  
done.  
Do jhāna, Sumaṅgala.  
Do jhāna, Sumaṅgala.  
Sumaṅgala, stay heedful.

## [1.49 Rāmaṇeyyaka](../thag1.49/)

Even with all the whistles & whistling,  
the calls of the birds,  
this, my mind, doesn’t waver,  
for my delight is in  
oneness.

## [1.50 Vimala](../thag1.50/)

The earth’s sprinkled  
with rain, wind  
is blowing, lightning  
wanders the sky,  
but my thoughts are stilled,  
well-centered  
my mind.

## [1.56 Kuṭivihārin](../thag1.56/)

Who’s in the hut?  
A monk’s in the hut—  
free from passion,  
with well-centered mind.  
Know this, my friend:  
The hut you built  
wasn’t wasted.

## [1.57 Kuṭivihārin](../thag1.57/)

This was your old hut,
and you aspire to another,
new hut.
Discard your hope for a hut, monk.
A new hut will be
painful all over again.[^1]

## [1.61 Vappa](../thag1.61/)

One who sees  
sees who sees,  
sees who doesn’t.  
One who doesn’t see  
doesn’t  
see who sees  
or who doesn’t.

## [1.68 Ekudāniya](../thag1.68/)

Of heightened awareness & heedful,  
the sage trained in sagacity’s ways:  
He has no sorrows, one who is Such,  
calmed & ever mindful.

## [1.73 Māṇava](../thag1.73/)

On seeing an old person;  
&  
a person in pain, diseased;  
&  
a person dead, gone to life’s end,  
I left  
for the life gone forth,  
abandoning the sensuality  
that entices the heart.

## [1.75 Susārada](../thag1.75/)

Good the sight  
of the well-rectified:  
Doubt is cut off,  
intelligence grows.  
Even fools  
they make wise—  
so the company of the true  
is good.

## [1.84 Nīta](../thag1.84/)

Asleep the whole night,  
delighting in company by day:  
When, when  
will the fool  
bring suffering & stress  
to an end?

## [1.85 Sunāga](../thag1.85/)

Adept in a theme for the mind,  
sensing the savor of solitude,  
practicing jhāna,  
masterful, mindful,  
you’d attain a pleasure  
not of the flesh.[^1]

## [1.86 Nāgita](../thag1.86/)

Outside of this path,  
the path of the many  
who teach other things  
doesn’t go to unbinding  
as does this:  
Thus the Blessed One  
instructs the Saṅgha,  
truly showing the palms of his hands.[^1]

## [1.88 Ajjuna](../thag1.88/)

Able was I
to raise myself from water
to dry land.[^1]
Swept along by the great flood,
I penetrated
the truths.[^2]

## [1.93 Eraka](../thag1.93/)

Sensual pleasures are stressful,  
Eraka.  
Sensual pleasures aren’t ease.  
Whoever loves sensual pleasures  
loves stress,     Eraka.  
Whoever doesn’t,  
doesn’t love stress.

## [1.95 Cakkhupāla](../thag1.95/)

I’m blind,
my eyes are destroyed.
I’ve stumbled
on a wilderness track.
Even
if I must crawl,
I’ll go on,
but not with an evil companion.

## [1.100 Devasabha](../thag1.100/)

Consummate in the right exertions,  
the establishings of mindfulness his range,[^1]  
blanketed with the flowers of release,  
he will, without effluent, totally unbind.[^2]

## [1.101 Belaṭṭhkāni](../thag1.101/)

Abandoning the householder’s state,  
but with no mastery,  
lazy, gluttonous,  
using his mouth as a plough  
like a great hog fattened on fodder:  
Again & again  
he goes to the womb—  
the dullard.

## [1.104 Khitaka](../thag1.104/)

How light my body!  
Touched by abundant  
rapture & bliss,  
—like a cotton tuft  
borne on the breeze—  
it seems to be floating  
—my body!

## [1.109 Saṅgharakkhita](../thag1.109/)

Why,  
having gone into solitude,  
does he not take account  
of the message  
of the one sympathetic  
to his foremost well-being?  
Because he dwells  
with his faculties  
exposed,  
like a tender deer  
in the forest.

## [1.110 Usabha](../thag1.110/)

Trees on the hilltops  
are flourishing,  
watered by a new high-rising cloud,  
giving birth to even more goodness  
for Usabha—  
desiring seclusion,  
conscious of  
“wilderness.”

## [1.111 Jenta](../thag1.111/)

Going forth is hard;  
houses are hard places to live;  
the Dhamma is deep;  
wealth, hard to obtain;  
it’s hard to keep going  
with whatever we get:  
So it’s right that we ponder  
continually  
continual  
inconstancy.

## [1.113 Vanavaccha](../thag1.113/)

With clear waters &  
massive boulders,  
frequented by monkeys &  
deer,  
covered with moss &  
water weeds:  
Those rocky crags refresh me.

## [1.114 Adhimutta](../thag1.114/)

For one heavy  
with bodily offenses,  
greedy  
for carcass pleasures  
while life is wasting away:  
From where will there come  
contemplative-excellence?

## [1.118 Kimbila](../thag1.118/)

As if sent by a curse,[^1]  
it drops on us—  
aging.  
The body seems     other,  
though it’s still the same one.  
I’m still here  
& have never been absent from it,  
but I remember myself  
as if somebody else’s.

## [1.119 Vajjiputta](../thag1.119/)

Coming to the bower  
at the root of a tree,  
placing  
unbinding  
in your heart,  
do jhāna, Gotama,  
& don’t be heedless.  
What use is this  
chitter-chatter  
to you?[^1]

## [1.120 Isidatta](../thag1.120/)

The five aggregates,  
having been comprehended,  
stand with their root  
cut through.  
For me  
the ending of stress  
is reached;  
the ending of effluents,  
attained.
