# Chapter Three

## [3.5 Mātaṅgaputta](../thag3.5/)

It’s too cold,  
too hot,  
too late in the evening—  
people who say this,  
shirking their work:  
The moment passes them by.  
Whoever regards cold & heat  
as no more than grass,  
doing his manly duties,  
won’t fall away  
from ease.  
With my chest  
I push through wild grasses—  
spear-grass,  
ribbon-grass,  
rushes—  
cultivating a heart  
bent on seclusion.

## [3.8 Yasoja](../thag3.8/)

His limbs knotted  
like a kālā plant,  
his body lean  
& lined with veins,  
knowing moderation  
in food & drink:  
the man of undaunted heart.  
Touched by gnats  
& horseflies  
in the wilds,  
the great wood,  
like an elephant  
at the head of a battle:  
He, mindful,  
should stay there,  
endure.  
One alone is like Brahmā,  
two, like devas,  
three, like a village,  
more than that:  
a hullabaloo.

## [3.9 Satimattiya](../thag3.9/)

Before, you had faith.  
Today you don’t.  
What is yours  
is just for you.  
I’ve done nothing wrong.  
For I’ve seen that faith is inconstant,  
wavering.  
Even they who are passionate  
lose their passion.  
Why should a sage waste away over that?  
A sage’s meal is cooked  
little by little, in this family and that.  
I will go for alms.  
I have the strength of my legs.

## [3.13 Abhibhūta](../thag3.13/)

Listen, kinsmen, all of you,  
as many as are assembled here.  
I will teach you the Dhamma:  
Painful is birth,  
again & again.  
Rouse yourselves.  
Go forth.  
Apply yourselves  
to the Awakened One’s bidding.  
Scatter the army of Death  
as an elephant would  
a shed made of reeds.  
He who,  
in this Dhamma & Vinaya,  
stays heedful,  
abandoning birth,  
the wandering-on,  
will put an end  
to suffering & stress.

## [3.14 Gotama](../thag3.14/)

While wandering on\
I went to hell;\
went again & again\
to the world of the hungry ghosts;\
stayed countless times, long,\
in the pain of the animal womb;\
enjoyed\
the human state;\
went to heaven\
from time to time;\
settled in the elements of form,\
the elements of formlessness,\
neither perception, perception-less.\
Ways of taking birth\
are now known:\
devoid of essence,\
unstable,\
conditioned,\
always blown along.\
Knowing them\
as born from my self,\
mindful\
I went right to peace.

## [3.15 Hārita](../thag3.15/)

Whoever wants to do later\
what he should have done first,\
falls away from the easeful state\
& later repents.\
One should speak\
as one would act,\
& not\
as one wouldn’t.\
When one speaks without acting,\
the wise, they can tell.\
How very easeful:\
unbinding,\
as taught by the Rightly\
Self-awakened One—\
sorrowless,\
dustless,\
secure,\
where stress\
& suffering\
cease.
