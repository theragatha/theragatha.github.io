# 3.5 Mātaṅgaputta

It’s too cold,  
too hot,  
too late in the evening—  
people who say this,  
shirking their work:  
The moment passes them by.  
Whoever regards cold & heat  
as no more than grass,  
doing his manly duties,  
won’t fall away  
from ease.  
With my chest  
I push through wild grasses—  
spear-grass,  
ribbon-grass,  
rushes—  
cultivating a heart  
bent on seclusion.
