# 3.13 Abhibhūta

Listen, kinsmen, all of you,  
as many as are assembled here.  
I will teach you the Dhamma:  
Painful is birth,  
again & again.  
Rouse yourselves.  
Go forth.  
Apply yourselves  
to the Awakened One’s bidding.  
Scatter the army of Death  
as an elephant would  
a shed made of reeds.  
He who,  
in this Dhamma & Vinaya,  
stays heedful,  
abandoning birth,  
the wandering-on,  
will put an end  
to suffering & stress.
