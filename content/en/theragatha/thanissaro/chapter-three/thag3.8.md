# 3.8 Yasoja

His limbs knotted  
like a kālā plant,  
his body lean  
& lined with veins,  
knowing moderation  
in food & drink:  
the man of undaunted heart.  
Touched by gnats  
& horseflies  
in the wilds,  
the great wood,  
like an elephant  
at the head of a battle:  
He, mindful,  
should stay there,  
endure.  
One alone is like Brahmā,  
two, like devas,  
three, like a village,  
more than that:  
a hullabaloo.
