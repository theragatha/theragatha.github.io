# 3.15 Hārita

Whoever wants to do later\
what he should have done first,\
falls away from the easeful state\
& later repents.\
One should speak\
as one would act,\
& not\
as one wouldn’t.\
When one speaks without acting,\
the wise, they can tell.\
How very easeful:\
unbinding,\
as taught by the Rightly\
Self-awakened One—\
sorrowless,\
dustless,\
secure,\
where stress\
& suffering\
cease.
