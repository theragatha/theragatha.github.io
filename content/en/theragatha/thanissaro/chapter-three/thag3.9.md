# 3.9 Satimattiya

Before, you had faith.  
Today you don’t.  
What is yours  
is just for you.  
I’ve done nothing wrong.  
For I’ve seen that faith is inconstant,  
wavering.  
Even they who are passionate  
lose their passion.  
Why should a sage waste away over that?  
A sage’s meal is cooked  
little by little, in this family and that.  
I will go for alms.  
I have the strength of my legs.
