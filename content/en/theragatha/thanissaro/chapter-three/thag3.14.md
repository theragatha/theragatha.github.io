# 3.14 Gotama

While wandering on\
I went to hell;\
went again & again\
to the world of the hungry ghosts;\
stayed countless times, long,\
in the pain of the animal womb;\
enjoyed\
the human state;\
went to heaven\
from time to time;\
settled in the elements of form,\
the elements of formlessness,\
neither perception, perception-less.\
Ways of taking birth\
are now known:\
devoid of essence,\
unstable,\
conditioned,\
always blown along.\
Knowing them\
as born from my self,\
mindful\
I went right to peace.
