# 14.2 Godatta

Just as a fine, well-bred bull\
yoked to a load,\
enduring his load,\
crushed\
by the heavy burden,\
doesn’t throw down his yoke;\
so, too, those who are filled with discernment\
—as the ocean, with water—\
don’t look down on others.\
This is nobility among beings.\
Having fallen in time\
under the sway of time,\
having come under the sway\
of becoming & not-,\
people fall subject to pain\
& they grieve.\
Elated       by causes of pleasure,\
cast down     by causes of pain,\
fools are destroyed\
by both,\
not seeing them\
for what they are.\
While those who, in the midst of\
pleasure & pain\
have gone past the seamstress—craving—,\
stand firm\
like a boundary pillar,\
neither elated nor cast down.\
Not to gain or loss\
not to status or honor,\
not to praise or blame,\
not to pleasure or pain:\
Everywhere\
they do not adhere—\
like a water bead\
on a lotus.\
Everywhere\
they are happy, the enlightened,[^1]\
everywhere\
un-\
defeated.\
No matter what\
the unrighteous gain\
or the righteous loss,\
righteous loss is better\
than if there were unrighteous gain.\
No matter what\
the status of the unaware\
or the lowliness of those who know,\
the lowliness of those who know\
is better,\
not the status of those\
unaware.\
No matter what\
the praise from fools\
or the censure from those who know,\
the censure from those who know\
is better\
than if there were praise\
from fools.\
And as for the pleasure\
from sensuality\
and the pain from seclusion,\
the pain from seclusion\
is better\
than if there were pleasure\
from sensuality.\
And as for living through unrighteousness\
and dying for righteousness,\
dying for righteousness\
is better,\
than if one were to live\
through unrighteousness.\
Those who’ve abandoned\
sensuality & anger,\
whose minds are calmed\
from becoming & non-,\
go through the world\
unattached.\
For them there is nothing\
dear or undear.\
Developing\
the factors for awakening,\
faculties,\
& strengths,\
attaining the foremost peace,\
they, without effluent,\
totally\
unbind.
