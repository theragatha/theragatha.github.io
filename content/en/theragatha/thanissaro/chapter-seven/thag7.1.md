# 7.1 Sundara Samudda & the Courtesan

Ornamented, finely clothed,\
garlanded, adorned,\
her feet stained red with lac,\
she wore slippers:\
a courtesan.\
Stepping out of her slippers—\
her hands raised before me,\
palm-to-palm over her heart—\
she softly, tenderly,\
in measured words\
spoke to me first:\
“You are young, recluse.\
Heed my message:\
Partake of human sensuality.\
I will give you luxury.\
Truly I vow to you,\
I will tend to you as to a fire.\
When we are old,\
both leaning on canes,\
then we will both become recluses,\
winning the benefits of both worlds.”\
And seeing her before me—\
a courtesan, ornamented, finely clothed,\
hands palm-to-palm over her heart—\
like a snare of death laid out,\
apt attention arose in me,\
the drawbacks appeared,\
disenchantment stood\
at an even keel:\
With that, my heart was released.\
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!\
The three knowledges\
have been attained;\
the Buddha’s bidding,\
done.
