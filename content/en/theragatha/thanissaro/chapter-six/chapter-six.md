# Chapter Six

## [6.2 Tekicchakāni](../thag6.2/)

The grain: harvested.\
The rice: gone to be threshed.\
But I don’t get any alms.\
How will I get by?\
Confident, recollect\
the immeasurable Buddha.\
Your body pervaded with rapture,\
you’ll be at the height\
of continual joy.\
Confident, recollect\
the immeasurable Dhamma.\
Your body pervaded with rapture,\
you’ll be at the height\
of continual joy.\
Confident, recollect\
the immeasurable Saṅgha.\
Your body pervaded with rapture,\
you’ll be at the height\
of continual joy.\
You live in the open air.\
Cold are these wintry nights.\
Don’t suffer, overcome with the cold.\
Go into your hut, with its fastened bolt.\
I’ll fasten the four\
immeasurables.\
With them, I’ll dwell\
in comfort.\
I won’t suffer from the cold,\
dwelling\
unperturbed.

## [6.3 Mahānāga](../thag6.3/)

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is not found,\
wastes away from the True Dhamma\
like a fish in next to no water.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is not found,\
doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,\
like a rotten seed in a field.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is not found,\
is far away from unbinding\
in the teaching of the Dhamma king.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is found,\
doesn’t waste away from the True Dhamma\
like a fish in plentiful water.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is found,\
grows in the True Dhamma,\
like an excellent seed in a field.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is found,\
stands right in the presence of unbinding\
in the teaching of the Dhamma king.

## [6.5 Māluṅkyaputta](../thag6.5/)

When a person lives heedlessly,\
his craving grows like a creeping vine.\
He runs now here\
& now there,\
as if looking for fruit:\
a monkey in the forest.\
If this sticky, uncouth craving\
overcomes you in the world,\
your sorrows grow like wild grass\
after rain.\
If, in the world, you overcome\
this uncouth craving, hard to escape,\
sorrows roll off you,\
like water beads off\
a lotus.\
To all of you gathered here\
I say:\
Good fortune.\
Dig up craving\
—as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass—\
by the root.\
Don’t let Māra cut you down\
—as a raging river, a reed—\
over & over again.\
Do what the Buddha says.\
Don’t let the moment pass by.\
Those for whom the moment is past\
grieve, consigned to hell.\
Heedlessness is dust.\
Dust follows on heedlessness.\
Through heedfulness, knowledge,\
pull out\
your own arrow\
on your own.

## [6.6 Sappadāsa](../thag6.6/)

Twenty five years since my going forth,\
and no peace of awareness\
—not a finger-snap’s worth—\
attained.\
Having gained no oneness of mind,\
I was wracked with lust.\
Wailing, with my arms upheld,\
I ran amok from my dwelling—\
“Or… or shall I take the knife?\
What’s the use of life to me?\
If I were to renounce the training,\
what sort of death would I have?”\
So, taking a razor,\
I sat down on a bed.\
And there was the razor,\
placed ready to cut my own vein,\
when apt attention arose in me,\
the drawbacks appeared,\
disenchantment stood\
at an even keel:\
With that, my heart was released.\
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!\
The three knowledges\
have been attained;\
the Awakened One’s bidding,\
done.

## [6.9 Jenta, the Royal Chaplain’s Son](../thag6.9/)

I was\
drunk with the intoxication\
of my birth, wealth, & sovereignty.\
Drunk with the intoxication\
of my body’s build, coloring, & form,\
I wandered about,\
regarding no one\
as my equal or better.\
Foolish, arrogant, haughty,\
my banner held high.\
I—disrespectful, arrogant, proud—\
bowed down to no one,\
not even\
mother,\
father,\
or those commonly held\
in respect.\
Then—seeing the ultimate leader,\
supreme, foremost of charioteers,\
like a blazing sun,\
arrayed with a squadron of monks—\
casting away pride & intoxication\
through an awareness serene & clear,\
I bowed down\
my\
head\
to him, supreme\
among all living beings.\
Haughtiness & contempt\
have been abandoned\
—rooted out—\
the conceit “I am” is extracted,\
all forms of pride, destroyed.

## [6.10 Sumana the Novice](../thag6.10/)

When I was seven\
& newly gone forth,\
having conquered with my power\
the great powerful serpent,\
I was fetching water for my preceptor\
from the great lake, Anotatta,\
when the Teacher saw me & said:\
“Look, Sāriputta, at that one,\
the young boy coming there,\
carrying a pot of water,\
well-centered within,\
his practices—inspiring;\
his bearing—admirable.\
He’s Anuruddha’s novice,\
mature in his powers,\
made thoroughbred by a thoroughbred,\
good by one who is good,\
tamed by Anuruddha,\
trained by one whose task\
is done.\
He, having reached the highest peace\
& realized the unshakable,\
Sumana the novice\
wants this:\
‘Don’t let anyone know me.’”

## [6.12 Brahmadatta](../thag6.12/)

Whence is there anger\
in one without anger\
tamed, calmed, living in tune,\
released through right knowing,\
Such?\
You make things worse\
when you flare up\
at someone who’s angry.\
Whoever doesn’t flare up\
at someone who’s angry\
wins a battle\
hard to win.\
You live for the good of both\
—your own, the other’s—\
when, knowing the other’s provoked,\
you mindfully grow calm.\
When you work the cure of both\
—your own, the other’s—\
those who think you a fool\
know nothing of Dhamma.\
If anger arises,\
reflect on the saw simile.\
If craving for savor,\
remember the son’s-flesh simile.\
If your mind runs loose\
after sensual pleasures\
& states of becoming,\
quickly restrain it with mindfulness\
as you would a bad ox\
eating grain.

## [6.13 Sirimaṇḍa](../thag6.13/)

Rain soddens what’s covered\
& doesn’t sodden what’s exposed.\
So open up what’s covered up,\
so that it won’t get soddened by the rain.\
Attacked by death\
is the world,\
surrounded by aging,\
beset by the arrow of craving,\
always obscured by desire.\
Attacked by death\
is the world,\
& encircled by aging,\
constantly beaten, with no shelter,\
like a thief\
sentenced to punishment.\
They encroach like masses of flame,\
these three:\
death, aging, & illness.\
There’s no strength to confront them,\
no speed to run away.\
Make the day not-in-vain,\
a little or a lot.\
However much\
the day passes,\
that’s how much less\
is life.\
Your last day approaches.\
This isn’t your time\
to be heedless.
