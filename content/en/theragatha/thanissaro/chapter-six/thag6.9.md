# 6.9 Jenta, the Royal Chaplain’s Son

I was\
drunk with the intoxication\
of my birth, wealth, & sovereignty.\
Drunk with the intoxication\
of my body’s build, coloring, & form,\
I wandered about,\
regarding no one\
as my equal or better.\
Foolish, arrogant, haughty,\
my banner held high.\
I—disrespectful, arrogant, proud—\
bowed down to no one,\
not even\
mother,\
father,\
or those commonly held\
in respect.\
Then—seeing the ultimate leader,\
supreme, foremost of charioteers,\
like a blazing sun,\
arrayed with a squadron of monks—\
casting away pride & intoxication\
through an awareness serene & clear,\
I bowed down\
my\
head\
to him, supreme\
among all living beings.\
Haughtiness & contempt\
have been abandoned\
—rooted out—\
the conceit “I am” is extracted,\
all forms of pride, destroyed.
