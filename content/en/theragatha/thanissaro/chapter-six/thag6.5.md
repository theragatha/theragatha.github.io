# 6.5 Māluṅkyaputta

When a person lives heedlessly,\
his craving grows like a creeping vine.\
He runs now here\
& now      there,\
as if looking for fruit:\
a monkey in the forest.\
If this sticky, uncouth craving\
overcomes you in the world,\
your sorrows grow like wild grass\
after rain.\
If, in the world, you overcome\
this uncouth craving, hard to escape,\
sorrows roll off you,\
like water beads off\
a lotus.\
To all of you gathered here\
I say:\
Good fortune.\
Dig up craving\
—as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass—\
by the root.\
Don’t let Māra cut you down\
—as a raging river, a reed—\
over & over again.[^1]\
Do what the Buddha says.\
Don’t let the moment pass by.\
Those for whom the moment is past\
grieve, consigned to hell.[^2]\
Heedlessness is dust.\
Dust follows on heedlessness.\
Through heedfulness, knowledge,\
pull out\
your own arrow\
on your own.
