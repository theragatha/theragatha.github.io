# 6.10 Sumana the Novice

When I was seven\
& newly gone forth,\
having conquered with my power\
the great powerful serpent,\
I was fetching water for my preceptor\
from the great lake, Anotatta,[^1]\
when the Teacher saw me & said:\
“Look, Sāriputta, at that one,\
the young boy coming there,\
carrying a pot of water,\
well-centered within,\
his practices—inspiring;\
his bearing—admirable.\
He’s Anuruddha’s novice,\
mature in his powers,\
made thoroughbred by a thoroughbred,\
good by one who is good,\
tamed by Anuruddha,\
trained by one whose task\
is done.\
He,     having reached the highest peace\
& realized the unshakable,\
Sumana the novice\
wants this:\
‘Don’t let anyone know me.’”

## Notes

[^1]: Anotatta: A fabulous lake located in the Himalayas, famed for the purity of its cool waters. Sumana would have had to use his psychic powers to fetch water from there.
