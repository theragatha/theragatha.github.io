# 6.6 Sappadāsa

Twenty five years since my going forth,\
and no peace of awareness\
—not a finger-snap’s worth—\
attained.\
Having gained no oneness of mind,\
I was wracked with lust.\
Wailing, with my arms upheld,\
I ran amok from my dwelling—\
“Or… or shall I take the knife?\
What’s the use of life to me?\
If I were to renounce the training,\
what sort of death would I have?”\
So, taking a razor,\
I sat down on a bed.\
And there was the razor,\
placed ready to cut my own vein,\
when apt attention arose in me,\
the drawbacks appeared,\
disenchantment stood\
at an even keel:\
With that, my heart was released.\
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!\
The three knowledges\
have been attained;\
the Awakened One’s bidding,\
done.
