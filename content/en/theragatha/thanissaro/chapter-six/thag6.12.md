# 6.12 Brahmadatta

Whence is there anger\
in one without anger\
tamed, calmed, living in tune,\
released through right knowing,\
Such?\
You make things worse\
when you flare up\
at someone who’s angry.\
Whoever doesn’t flare up\
at someone who’s angry\
wins a battle\
hard to win.\
You live for the good of both\
—your own, the other’s—\
when, knowing the other’s provoked,\
you mindfully grow calm.\
When you work the cure of both\
—your own, the other’s—\
those who think you a fool\
know nothing of Dhamma.\
If anger arises,\
reflect on the saw simile.[^1]\
If craving for savor,\
remember the son’s-flesh simile.[^2]\
If your mind runs loose\
after sensual pleasures\
& states of becoming,\
quickly restrain it with mindfulness\
as you would a bad ox\
eating grain.[^3]
