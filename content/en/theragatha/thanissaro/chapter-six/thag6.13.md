# 6.13 Sirimaṇḍa

Rain soddens what’s covered\
& doesn’t sodden what’s exposed.\
So open up what’s covered up,\
so that it won’t get soddened by the rain.[^1]\
Attacked by death\
is the world,\
surrounded by aging,\
beset by the arrow of craving,\
always obscured by desire.\
Attacked by death\
is the world,\
& encircled by aging,\
constantly beaten, with no shelter,\
like a thief\
sentenced to punishment.\
They encroach like masses of flame,\
these three:\
death, aging, & illness.\
There’s no strength to confront them,\
no speed to run away.\
Make the day not-in-vain,\
a little or a lot.\
However much\
the day passes,\
that’s how much less\
is life.\
Your last day approaches.\
This isn’t your time\
to be heedless.
