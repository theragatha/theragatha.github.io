# 6.3 Mahānāga

One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is not found,\
wastes away from the True Dhamma\
like a fish in next to no water.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is not found,\
doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,\
like a rotten seed in a field.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is not found,\
is far away from unbinding\
in the teaching of the Dhamma king.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is found,\
doesn’t waste away from the True Dhamma\
like a fish in plentiful water.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is found,\
grows in the True Dhamma,\
like an excellent seed in a field.\
One in whom respect for his fellows in the holy life\
is found,\
stands right in the presence of unbinding\
in the teaching of the Dhamma king.
