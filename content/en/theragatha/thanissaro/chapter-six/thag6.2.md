# 6.2 Tekicchakāni

The grain: harvested.\
The rice: gone to be threshed.\
But I don’t get any alms.\
How will I get by?\
Confident, recollect\
the immeasurable Buddha.\
Your body pervaded with rapture,\
you’ll be at the height\
of continual joy.\
Confident, recollect\
the immeasurable Dhamma.\
Your body pervaded with rapture,\
you’ll be at the height\
of continual joy.\
Confident, recollect\
the immeasurable Saṅgha.\
Your body pervaded with rapture,\
you’ll be at the height\
of continual joy.\
You live in the open air.\
Cold are these wintry nights.\
Don’t suffer, overcome with the cold.\
Go into your hut, with its fastened bolt.\
I’ll fasten the four\
immeasurables.[^1]\
With them, I’ll dwell\
in comfort.\
I won’t suffer from the cold,\
dwelling\
unperturbed.
