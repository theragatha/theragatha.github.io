# 5.8 Vakkali

Stricken by sharp, wind-like pains,\
you, monk, living in the forest grove\
—harsh, with limited range for alms—\
what, what will you do?\
Suffusing my body\
with abundant rapture & joy,\
& enduring what’s harsh,\
I’ll stay in the grove.\
Developing the establishings of mindfulness,\
strengths, faculties,\
the factors for awakening,[^1]\
I’ll stay in the grove.\
Reflecting on those who are resolute,\
their persistence aroused,\
constantly firm in their effort,\
united in concord,\
I’ll stay in the grove.\
Recollecting the One Self-awakened,\
self-tamed & centered,v
untiring both day & night,\
I’ll stay\
in the grove.
