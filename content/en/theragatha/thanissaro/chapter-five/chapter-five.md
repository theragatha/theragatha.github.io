# Chapter Five

## [5.1 Rājadatta](../thag5.1/)

I, a monk,\
gone to the charnel ground,\
saw a woman cast away,\
discarded\
there in the cemetery.\
Though some were disgusted,\
seeing her—dead, evil—\
lust\
appeared,\
as if I were blind\
to the oozings.\
In less time than it takes\
for rice to cook,\
I got out of that place.\
Mindful, alert, I\
sat down to one side.\
Then apt attention arose in me,\
the drawbacks appeared,\
disenchantment stood\
at an even keel:\
With that, my heart was released.\
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!\
The three knowledges\
have been attained;\
the Awakened One’s bidding,\
done.

## [5.8 Vakkali](../thag5.8/)

Stricken by sharp, wind-like pains,\
you, monk, living in the forest grove\
—harsh, with limited range for alms—\
what, what will you do?\
Suffusing my body\
with abundant rapture & joy,\
& enduring what’s harsh,\
I’ll stay in the grove.\
Developing the establishings of mindfulness,\
strengths, faculties,\
the factors for awakening,\
I’ll stay in the grove.\
Reflecting on those who are resolute,\
their persistence aroused,\
constantly firm in their effort,\
united in concord,\
I’ll stay in the grove.\
Recollecting the One Self-awakened,\
self-tamed & centered,v
untiring both day & night,\
I’ll stay\
in the grove.

## [5.10 Yasadatta](../thag5.10/)

Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He’s as far from the True Dhamma\
as the ground is from the sky.\
Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He wanes from the True Dhamma\
like the moon in the dark half of the month.\
Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He dries up in the True Dhamma\
like a fish in next to no water.\
Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,\
like a rotten seed in a field.\
But whoever hears the Conqueror’s teaching\
with guarded intent,\
doing away with effluents\
—all—\
realizing the unshakable,\
attaining the foremost peace,\
—effluent-free—\
totally unbinds.
