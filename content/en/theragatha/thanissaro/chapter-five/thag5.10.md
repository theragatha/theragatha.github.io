# 5.10 Yasadatta

Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He’s as far from the True Dhamma\
as the ground is from the sky.\
Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He wanes from the True Dhamma\
like the moon in the dark half of the month.\
Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He dries up in the True Dhamma\
like a fish in next to no water.\
Intent on quibbling,\
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.\
He doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,\
like a rotten seed in a field.\
But whoever hears the Conqueror’s teaching\
with guarded[^1] intent,\
doing away with effluents\
—all—\
realizing the unshakable,\
attaining the foremost peace,\
—effluent-free—\
totally unbinds.

## Notes
