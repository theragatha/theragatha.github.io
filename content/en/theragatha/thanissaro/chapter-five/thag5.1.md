# 5.1 Rājadatta

I, a monk,\
gone to the charnel ground,\
saw a woman cast away,\
discarded\
there in the cemetery.\
Though some were disgusted,\
seeing her—dead, evil—\
lust\
appeared,\
as if I were blind\
to the oozings.\
In less time than it takes\
for rice to cook,\
I got out of that place.\
Mindful, alert, I\
sat down to one side.\
Then apt attention arose in me,\
the drawbacks appeared,\
disenchantment stood\
at an even keel:\
With that, my heart was released.\
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!\
The three knowledges\
have been attained;\
the Awakened One’s bidding,\
done.
