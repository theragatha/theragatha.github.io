# 4.10 Dhammika

The Dhamma protects\
those who live by the Dhamma.\
The Dhamma well-practiced\
brings bliss.\
This—the reward\
when the Dhamma’s well-practiced:\
One who lives by the Dhamma\
doesn’t go to a bad destination.\
For Dhamma and non-\
don’t bear equal results.\
Non-Dhamma leads you to hell;\
Dhamma, to a good destination.\
So you should engender desire\
for acts of Dhamma,\
rejoicing\
in the One     Well-Gone,\
the one      who is Such.\
Standing firm in the Dhamma,\
of the foremost\
One Well-Gone,\
his disciples are guided\
—enlightened—\
to the foremost\
refuge supreme.\
Burst       is the root of the boil;\
the net of craving     uprooted.\
He, having ended his wandering-on,\
has no stain—\
like the moon\
on a clear full-moon night.
