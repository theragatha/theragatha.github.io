# 4.2 Bhagu

I, overcome with torpor,\
left my dwelling.\
Stepping up on the walking path,\
I fell on the ground\
right there.\
Rubbing my limbs,\
I got up on the path again.\
Walking back & forth on the path,\
I became well-centered within.\
Apt attention arose in me,\
the drawbacks appeared,\
disenchantment stood\
at an even keel:\
With that, my heart was released.\
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!\
The three knowledges\
have been attained;\
the Buddha’s bidding,\
done.
