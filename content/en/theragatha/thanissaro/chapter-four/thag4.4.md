# 4.4 Nandaka

A curse on bodies—\
full of foul smells,\
siding with Māra,\
oozing,\
where nine streams are always flowing.\
Don’t think much of them,\
Don’t offend the Tathāgatas,\
who don’t delight even in heaven,\
to say nothing of the human realm.\
But fools of little intelligence,\
with bad advisers,\
cloaked in delusion:\
Those sorts of people delight there\
in the snare that Māra’s thrown down.\
Whereas those dispassionate for\
passion,\
aversion,\
ignorance\
don’t delight there,\
have cut the cord,\
unsnared.
