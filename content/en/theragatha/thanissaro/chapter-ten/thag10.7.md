# 10.7 Gotama

You should know what’s to your benefit.\
You should take a good look\
at the Buddha’s word\
& at what’s fitting here\
for one who has entered\
on the contemplative life.\
An admirable friend right here,\
undertaking the complete training,\
& obedience to teachers:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Respect for the Buddhas,\
honoring the Dhamma\
as it has come to be,\
& thinking highly of the Saṅgha:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Fitting behavior & range of association,\
a livelihood purified, blameless,\
the establishing of the mind:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Virtuous in what you do\
& what you abstain from doing,\
inspiring comportment,\
commitment to the heightened mind:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Wilderness lodgings,\
secluded, with next-to-no noise,\
right for sages to resort to:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Virtue, learning,\
investigating\
phenomena,\
mental qualities,\
as they have come to be:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
You should develop\
inconstancy,\
the perception of not-self,\
the perception of unattractiveness,\
& distaste for the world:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
You should develop\
the factors for awakening,\
the bases for success,\
the faculties,\
& the noble eightfold path:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
A sage should abandon craving,\
should cut through the effluents, root & all,\
should dwell fully released:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.
