# Chapter Ten

## [10.1 Kāludāyin](../thag10.1/)

Covered in embers now are the trees,\
shedding their canopy, lord, in search of fruit.\
As if flaring up, they glow.\
The time, great hero, partakes of savors.\
The trees in bloom, delightful,\
waft delights\
all around, in all directions,\
dropping their petals in hope of fruit.\
Now, O hero, is the time to set forth.\
Neither too cold nor too hot:\
pleasant the season, lord, fit for a journey.\
Let them see you—the Sakyans & Koliyans—\
facing west, crossing in the Rohiṇī.\
In hope they plow the field.\
In hope the seed is sown.\
In hope do merchants go to sea,\
bringing back wealth.\
Let the hope in which I stand bear fruit.\
Again & again they sow the seed.\
Again & again the deva-kings rain.\
Again & again farmers plow the fields.\
Again & again grain comes to the kingdom.\
Again & again beggars wander.\
Again & again lords of giving give.\
Again & again having given, the lords of giving\
again & again go to the heavenly place.\

\* * \*

Truly, an enlightened one of deep discernment\
cleanses, back for seven generations,\
the family in which he’s born.\
I would imagine you to be Sakka, the deva of devas\
for you engendered a sage truly named.\
Suddhodana is the name of the Great Seer’s father,\
and Māyā name of the Buddha’s mother\
who, having nurtured the bodhisatta with her womb,\
at the break-up of the body, rejoices in the threefold divine realm.\
She, Gotamī, having passed away,\
having fallen away from here,\
is now endowed with heavenly sensual pleasures.\
She rejoices in the five strings of sensuality,\
surrounded by those groups of devas.\
I am the son of the Buddha,\
who endures what is hard to endure—\
Aṅgīrasa: incomparable, Such.\
You, Sakka, are my father’s father.\
In the Dhamma, Gotama,\
you are my grandfather.

## [10.2 Ekavihāriya—“Dwelling Alone”](../thag10.2/)

If, in front or behind,\
there is no one else,\
it’s extremely pleasant\
for one staying alone\
in the forest.\
Come then! Alone\
I will go to the wilderness\
praised by the Awakened One\
pleasant for a resolute monk\
dwelling alone.\
Alone,\
astute in my goal,\
I’ll quickly enter the grove\
—refreshing,\
giving rapture\
to meditators—\
the haunt\
of elephants in rut.\
When the Cool Forest’s in full flower,\
in a cool mountain gorge,\
having bathed my limbs\
I’ll walk back & forth\
alone.\
Ah, when will I dwell,\
alone and free from companions,\
in the refreshing great forest—\
my task done,\
effluent-free?\
As I desire to do this,\
may my purpose succeed.\
I myself\
will bring it about.\
No one can do it\
for anyone else.\
\* * \*
I myself\
bind on my armor.\
I will enter the grove\
and will not emerge\
without having attained\
the end of the effluents.\
While soft breezes blow—\
cool,\
heavily, fragrantly scented—\
I’ll make ignorance burst,\
as I sit on a mountaintop.\
In the forest covered with blossoms\
or perhaps on a cool hillside,\
blessed with the bliss of release,\
on Giribbaja I’ll delight.\
\* * \*
I am now he\
whose resolves are fulfilled\
like the moon on a full-moon night.\
With effluents all\
totally ended,\
there is now no further becoming.

## [10.5 Kappa](../thag10.5/)

Full of the many clans of impurities,\
the great manufacturer of excrement,\
like a stagnant pool,\
a great tumor,\
great wound,\
full of blood & lymph,\
immersed in a cesspool,\
trickling liquids, the body\
is oozing foulness—always.\
Bound together with sixty sinews,\
plastered with a stucco of muscle,\
wrapped in a jacket of skin,\
this foul body is of no worth at all.\
Linked together with a chain of bones,\
stitched together with tendon-threads,\
it produces its various postures,\
from being hitched up together.\
Headed surely to death,\
in the presence of the King of Mortality,\
the man who learns to discard it right here,\
goes wherever he wants.\
Covered with ignorance,\
the body’s tied down with a four-fold tie,\
sunk in the floods,\
caught in the net of obsessions,\
conjoined with five hindrances,\
given over to thought,\
accompanied with the root of craving,\
roofed with delusion’s roofing.\
That’s how the body functions,\
compelled by the compulsion of kamma,\
but its attainment ends\
in ruin.\
Its many becomings go\
to ruin.\
These who hold to this body as mine\
—blind fools, people run-of-the-mill—\
fill the horrific cemetery,\
taking on further becoming.\
Those who stay uninvolved with this body\
—as they would with a serpent\
smeared with dung—\
disgorging the root of becoming,\
will, without effluent,\
totally unbind.

## [10.7 Gotama](../thag10.7/)

You should know what’s to your benefit.\
You should take a good look\
at the Buddha’s word\
& at what’s fitting here\
for one who has entered\
on the contemplative life.\
An admirable friend right here,\
undertaking the complete training,\
& obedience to teachers:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Respect for the Buddhas,\
honoring the Dhamma\
as it has come to be,\
& thinking highly of the Saṅgha:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Fitting behavior & range of association,\
a livelihood purified, blameless,\
the establishing of the mind:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Virtuous in what you do\
& what you abstain from doing,\
inspiring comportment,\
commitment to the heightened mind:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Wilderness lodgings,\
secluded, with next-to-no noise,\
right for sages to resort to:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
Virtue, learning,\
investigating\
phenomena,\
mental qualities,\
as they have come to be:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
You should develop\
inconstancy,\
the perception of not-self,\
the perception of unattractiveness,\
& distaste for the world:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
You should develop\
the factors for awakening,\
the bases for success,\
the faculties,\
& the noble eightfold path:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.\
A sage should abandon craving,\
should cut through the effluents, root & all,\
should dwell fully released:\
This is fitting\
for a contemplative.
