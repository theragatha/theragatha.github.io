# 12.2 Sunīta the Outcaste

Into a lowly family I was born,\
poor, with next to no food.\
My work was degrading:\
I gathered the spoiled,\
the withered flowers from shrines\
and threw them away.\
People found me disgusting,\
despised me, disparaged me.\
Lowering my heart,\
I showed reverence to many.\
Then I saw the One Self-awakened,\
arrayed with a squadron of monks,\
the Great Hero, entering the city,\
supreme, of the Magadhans.\
Throwing down my carrying pole,\
I approached him to do reverence.\
He—the supreme man—stood still\
out of sympathy\
just\
for me.\
After paying homage\
to the feet of the teacher,\
I stood to one side\
& requested the Going Forth from him,\
supreme among all living beings.\
The compassionate Teacher,\
sympathetic to all the world, said:\
“Come, monk.”\
That was my formal Acceptance.\
Alone, I stayed in the wilds,\
untiring,\
I followed the Teacher’s words,\
just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.\
In the first watch of the night,\
I recollected previous lives;\
in the middle watch,\
purified the divine eye;\
in the last,\
burst the mass of darkness.\
Then, as night was ending\
& the sun returning,\
Indra & Brahmā came to pay homage to me,\
hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:\
“Homage to you,\
O thoroughbred of men,\
Homage to you,\
O man supreme,\
whose effluents are ended.\
You, dear sir,\
are worthy of offerings.”\
Seeing me,\
arrayed with a squadron of devas,\
the Teacher smiled & said:\
“Through austerity, celibacy,\
restraint, & self-control:\
That’s how one is a brahman.\
He is a brahman supreme.”
