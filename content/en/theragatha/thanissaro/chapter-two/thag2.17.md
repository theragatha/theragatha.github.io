# 2.17 Tissa

He gains many enemies,  
one who—shaven-headed,  
wearing an outer robe—  
gains food, drink, cloth, lodgings.  
Knowing this drawback,  
this great danger in honors,  
a monk, gaining little,  
not soggy,[^1]
should go forth  
mindfully.  

## Notes

[^1]: On the meaning of “soggy,” see SN 35:202 and Ud 5:5.
