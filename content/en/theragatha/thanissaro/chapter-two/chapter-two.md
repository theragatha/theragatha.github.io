# Chapter Two

## [2.3 Valliya](../thag2.3/)

A monkey,
coming to the little hut
with five doors,
goes from door to door, knocking
moment by moment.
Stand still, monkey,
don’t run.
It’s not yours
as it was before.
You’re bound by discernment.
You won’t get far away.

## [2.9 Gotama](../thag2.9/)

At ease sleep the sages
who
are not bound to women,
in whom
always to be protected
is the truth
very hard to gain.
Sensuality,
we’ve carried out
your execution.
No longer are we in your debt.
We go now to unbinding
where,
having gone,
one doesn’t
grieve.

## [2.11 Mahā Cunda](../thag2.11/)

Listening well increases learning.
What is learned increases discernment.
Through discernment one knows the goal.
When known, the goal brings bliss.
Stay in isolated lodgings;
live for freedom from fetters.
If you don’t attain delight there,
then live in the Saṅgha,
your mind protected,
mindful.

## [2.13 Heraññakāni](../thag2.13/)

Days & nights
fly past.
Life
comes to an end.
The span of mortals
runs out,
like the water of a piddling stream.
But the fool doing evil deeds
doesn’t realize that later
it’s bitter for him:
evil for him
the result.

## [2.16 Mahākāla](../thag2.16/)

This swarthy woman
[preparing a corpse for cremation]
—crow-like, enormous—
breaking a thigh & then the other
thigh,
breaking an arm & then the other
arm,
cracking open the head,
like a pot of curds,
she sits with them heaped up beside her.
Whoever, unknowing,
makes acquisitions
—the fool—
returns over & over
to suffering & stress.
So, discerning,
don’t make acquisitions.
May I never lie
with my head cracked open
again.

## [2.17 Tissa](../thag2.17/)

He gains many enemies,
one who—shaven-headed,
wearing an outer robe—
gains food, drink, cloth, lodgings.
Knowing this drawback,
this great danger in honors,
a monk, gaining little,
not soggy,
should go forth
mindfully.

## [2.19 Nanda](../thag2.19/)

From inappropriate attention
I was devoted to ornament,
restless & vain,
driven by sensual passion.
With the help of the Buddha,
the Kinsman of the Sun,
skilled in strategies,
I, practicing appropriately,
plucked my mind
out of becoming.

## [2.24 Valliya](../thag2.24/)

What needs to be done
with firm persistence,
what needs to be done
by one who hopes for awakening,
that I will do.
I will not fail.
See: persistence & striving!
You show me the path:
the straight,
the plunge into deathlessness.
I, through sagacity,
will reach it, know it,
as the stream of the Ganges,
the sea.

## [2.26 Puṇṇamāsa](../thag2.26/)

Shedding five hindrances
to reach rest from the yoke,
taking the Dhamma as mirror
my own knowledge & vision,
I reflected on this body—
the whole thing,
inside & out,
my own & others’.
How vain & empty the body appeared!

## [2.27 Nandaka](../thag2.27/)

Just as a fine thoroughbred steed
stumbling, regains its stance,
feeling all the more urgency,
& draws its burden
undaunted.
In the same way, remember me:
consummate in vision,
a disciple of the Rightly
Self-awakened One,
the Awakened One’s thoroughbred child,
his son.

## [2.30 Kaṇhadinna](../thag2.30/)

Men of integrity
have been attended to,
the Dhamma repeatedly
listened to.
Having listened,
I followed the straight way,
the plunge into deathlessness.
Passion for becoming,
having been killed by me,
no further such passion
is found in me.
It neither was
nor will be
nor is found in me
even now.

## [2.32 Sivaka](../thag2.32/)

Inconstant little houses:
now here,
now there, again
& again,
I sought the house-builder.
Painful is birth, again
& again.
House-builder, you’re seen!
You will not build a house again.
All your rafters are broken,
and your gables torn down.
Released from restriction, the mind
will
be blown out
right here.

## [2.36 Khitaka](../thag2.36/)

Whose mind, standing like rock,
doesn’t shake,
dispassionate for things that spark passion,
unprovoked by things that spark provocation?
When one’s mind is developed like this,
from where can there come to him
suffering & stress?
My mind, standing like rock,
doesn’t shake,
dispassionate for things that spark passion,
unprovoked by things that spark provocation.
When my mind is developed like this,
from where can there come to me
suffering & stress?

## [2.37 Soṇa Poṭiriyaputta](../thag2.37/)

It’s not for sleeping,
the night garlanded
with zodiac stars.
The night, for one who knows,
is for staying awake.
If I were to fall from my elephant’s shoulder,
and a tusker trampled me,
death in battle would be better for me,
than that I, defeated,
survive.

## [2.42 Dhammapāla](../thag2.42/)

The young monk
devoted to the Buddha’s message,
is wakeful among those who sleep.
His life is not in vain.
So, intelligent,
one should commit oneself
to conviction & virtue,
confidence & Dhamma-vision,
remembering the Buddhas’ message.

## [2.43 Brahmāli](../thag2.43/)

Whose faculties have been made tranquil,
like horses well-tamed by a charioteer —
effluents abandoned,
envied even by devas,
Such?
My faculties have been made tranquil
like horses well-tamed by a charioteer —
effluents abandoned,
I’m envied even by devas.
Such.

## [2.47 Anūpama](../thag2.47/)

Coming into the conceit of delight, the mind
impales itself on a stake.
Wherever’s a stake, a chopping block,
there, only there, you turn.
You, mind, I call an unlucky die.
You, I call a mind-traitor.
You’ve gained a Teacher hard to gain.
Don’t urge me on to my loss.
