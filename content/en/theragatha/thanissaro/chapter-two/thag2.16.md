# 2.16 Mahākāla

This swarthy woman  
[preparing a corpse for cremation]  
—crow-like, enormous—  
breaking a thigh & then the other  
thigh,  
breaking an arm & then the other  
arm,  
cracking open the head,  
like a pot of curds,  
she sits with them heaped up beside her.  
Whoever, unknowing,  
makes acquisitions  
—the fool—  
returns over & over  
to suffering & stress.  
So, discerning,  
don’t make acquisitions.  
May I never lie  
with my head cracked open  
again.
