# 2.37 Soṇa Poṭiriyaputta

It’s not for sleeping,  
the night garlanded  
with zodiac stars.  
The night, for one who knows,  
is for staying awake.  
If I were to fall from my elephant’s shoulder,  
and a tusker trampled me,  
death in battle would be better for me,  
than that I, defeated,  
survive.
