# 2.27 Nandaka

Just as a fine thoroughbred steed  
stumbling, regains its stance,  
feeling all the more urgency,  
& draws its burden  
undaunted.  
In the same way, remember me:  
consummate in vision,  
a disciple of the Rightly  
Self-awakened One,  
the Awakened One’s thoroughbred child,  
his son.
