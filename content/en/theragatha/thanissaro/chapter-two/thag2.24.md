# 2.24 Valliya

What needs to be done  
with firm persistence,  
what needs to be done  
by one who hopes for awakening,  
that I will do.  
I will not fail.  
See: persistence & striving!  
You show me the path:  
the straight,  
the plunge into deathlessness.  
I, through sagacity,  
will reach it, know it,  
as the stream of the Ganges,  
the sea.
