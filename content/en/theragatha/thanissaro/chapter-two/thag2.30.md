# 2.30 Kaṇhadinna

Men of integrity  
have been attended to,  
the Dhamma repeatedly  
listened to.  
Having listened,  
I followed the straight way,  
the plunge into deathlessness.  
Passion for becoming,[^1]  
having been killed by me,  
no further such passion  
is found in me.  
It neither was  
nor will be  
nor is found in me  
even now.  

## Notes

[^1]: Becoming (bhava) is a term to describe a sense of identity in a particular world of experience, which can develop on any of three levels: sensuality, form, or formlessness. Craving for becoming is one of the causes of stress and suffering; passion for becoming is one of the last fetters abandoned at full awakening. For more on the topic of becoming, see The Paradox of Becoming.
