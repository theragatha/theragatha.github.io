# 2.11 Mahā Cunda

Listening well increases learning.  
What is learned increases discernment.  
Through discernment one knows the goal.  
When known, the goal brings bliss.  
Stay in isolated lodgings;  
live for freedom from fetters.  
If you don’t attain delight there,  
then live in the Saṅgha,  
your mind protected,  
mindful.
