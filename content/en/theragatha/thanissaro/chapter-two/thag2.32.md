# 2.32 Sivaka

Inconstant little houses:  
now here,  
now there,       again  
& again,  
I sought the house-builder.  
Painful is birth, again  
& again.  
House-builder, you’re seen!  
You will not build a house again.  
All your rafters are broken,  
and your gables torn down.  
Released from restriction, the mind  
will  
be blown out  
right here.[^1]  


## Notes

[^1]: Compare Dhp 153–154:
Through the round of many births I roamed  
without reward,  
without rest,  
seeking the house-builder.  
Painful is birth again  
& again.  
House-builder, you’re seen!  
You will not build a house again.  
All your rafters broken,  
the roof plate destroyed,  
immersed what’s without limits, the mind  
will  
diffuse  
right here
