# 2.26 Puṇṇamāsa

Shedding five hindrances[^1]  
to reach rest from the yoke,  
taking the Dhamma as mirror  
my own knowledge & vision,  
I reflected on this body—  
the whole thing,  
inside & out,  
my own & others’.  
How vain & empty the body appeared!  

## Notes

[^1]: The five hindrances are sensual desire, ill will, sloth & drowsiness, restlessness & anxiety, and uncertainty. See SN 46:51.
