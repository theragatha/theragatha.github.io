# Chapter Three

## [3.1 Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja](../thag3.1/)

Seeking purity the wrong way,  
I worshipped the sacred fire in a grove.  
Not knowing the path to purity,  
I mortified my flesh in search of immortality.  

I’ve gained this happiness by means of happiness:  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

In the past I was related to Brahmā,  
But now I’m really a brahmin:  
I have the three knowledges, I’m cleansed,  
I’m an initiate,  
And I’m accomplished in sacred knowledge.

## [3.2 Paccaya](../thag3.2/)

I went forth five days ago,  
A trainee, with my heart’s goal unfulfilled.  
I entered my dwelling,  
And an aspiration arose in my mind.  

I won’t eat; I won’t drink;  
I won’t leave my dwelling;  
Nor will I lie down on my side—  
Until the dart of craving is pulled out.  

See my energy and effort  
As I practice this way!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.

## [3.3 Bākula](../thag3.3/)

Whoever wishes to do afterwards  
What they should have done before  
They’ve lost the causes for happiness,  
And afterwards they’re tormented with remorse.  

You should only say what you would do;  
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.  
The wise will recognize  
One who talks without doing.  

Oh! nibbāna is so very blissful,  
As taught by the fully awakened Buddha:  
Sorrowless, stainless, secure;  
Where suffering all ceases.

## [3.4 Dhaniya](../thag3.4/)

One who hopes for the ascetic life,  
Wishing to live in happiness,  
Should not look down on the Saṅgha’s robe,  
Or its food and drinks.  

One who hopes for the ascetic life,  
Wishing to live in happiness,  
Should stay in the Saṅgha’s lodgings,  
Like a snake in a mouse hole.  

One who hopes for the ascetic life,  
Wishing to live in happiness,  
Should be satisfied with whatever is offered,  
Developing this one quality.

## [3.5 Mātaṅgaputta](../thag3.5/)

“It’s too cold, too hot,  
Too late,” they say.  
Those who neglect their work like this—  
Opportunities pass them by.  

But one who considers hot and cold  
To be nothing more than a blade of grass;  
He does his manly duty,  
And his happiness never fails.  

With my chest I’ll thrust aside  
The grasses, vines, and creepers,  
And devote myself to seclusion.”

## [3.6 Khujjasobhita](../thag3.6/)

“One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—  
Such brilliant speakers, and very learned—  
Stands at the door:  
The old man, Khujjasobhita.  

One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—  
Such brilliant speakers, and very learned—  
Stands at the door:  
An old man, trembling in the wind.”  

“By war well fought, by sacrifice well made,  
By victory in battle;  
By living the spiritual life:  
That’s how this person flourishes in happiness.”

## [3.7 Vāraṇa](../thag3.7/)

Anyone among men  
Who harms other creatures:  
From this world and the next,  
That person will fall.  

But someone with a mind of loving-kindness,  
Compassionate for all creatures:  
That sort of person  
Gives rise to merit in abundance.  

One should train in good speech,  
In attending closely to ascetics,  
In sitting alone in hidden places,  
And in calming the mind.

## [3.8 Vassika](../thag3.8/)

I was the only one in my family  
Who had faith and wisdom.  
It’s good for my relatives that I’m  
Firm in Dhamma, and my conduct is virtuous.  

I rebuked my family out of compassion,  
Reprimanding them because of my love  
For my family and relatives.  

They performed a service for the monks  
And then they passed away,  
To find happiness in the heaven of the Thirty-three.  
There, my brothers and mother rejoice  
With all the pleasures they desire.

## [3.9 Yasoja](../thag3.9/)

“With knobbly knees,  
Thin, with veins matted on his skin,  
Eating and drinking in moderation—  
This person’s spirit is undaunted.”  

“Pestered by gadflies and mosquitoes  
In the awesome wilderness;  
One should mindfully endure,  
Like an elephant at the head of the battle.  

A monk alone is like Brahmā;  
A pair of monks are like devas;  
Three are like a village;  
And more than that is a rabble.”

## [3.10 Sāṭimattiya](../thag3.10/)

In the past you had faith,  
Today you have none.  
What’s yours is yours alone;  
I’ve done nothing wrong.  

Faith is impermanent, fickle—  
So I have seen.  
People’s passions wax and wane:  
Why should a sage grow old worrying about that?  

The meal of a sage is cooked  
Bit by bit, in this family or that.  
I’ll walk for alms,  
For my legs are strong.

## [3.11 Upāli](../thag3.11/)

One newly gone forth,  
Who has left their home out of faith,  
Should associate with spiritual friends,  
Whose livelihood is pure, and who are not lazy.  

One newly gone forth,  
Who has left their home out of faith,  
A monk who stays with the Saṅgha,  
Being wise, would train in monastic discipline.  

One newly gone forth,  
Who has left their home out of faith,  
Skilled in what is appropriate and what is not,  
Would wander undistracted.

## [3.12 Uttarapāla](../thag3.12/)

Sadly, I was intelligent and peaceful,  
But only enough to critically analyse the meaning.  
The five kinds of sensual pleasure in the world,  
So delusory, were my downfall.  

Entering into Māra’s domain,  
I was struck by a powerful dart;  
But I was able to free myself  
From the trap laid by the king of death.  

All sensual pleasures have been abandoned,  
Rebirth in all states of existence is torn apart,  
Transmigration through births is finished,  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.

## [3.13 Abhibhūta](../thag3.13/)

All my family gathered here,  
Listen to me,  
I’ll teach you Dhamma!  
Being born again and again is suffering.  
Rouse yourselves, let go!  
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!  
Crush the army of death,  
Like an elephant crushes a hut of reeds.  
Whoever will live heedfully  
In this Dhamma and discipline,  
Will abandon transmigration through births,  
And make an end to suffering.

## [3.14 Gotama](../thag3.14/)

Transmigrating, I went to hell;  
Again and again, I went to the ghost realm;  
Many times I dwelt long  
In the suffering of the animal realm.  
I was also reborn as a human;  
From time to time I went to heaven;  
I’ve stayed in the corporeal realms  
And the incorporeal,  
Among the percipient-nor-non-percipient,  
And the non-percipient.  
I understood these states of existence  
To be worthless:  
Conditioned, unstable, always in motion.  
When I understood the origin  
Of rebirth within myself,  
Mindful, I found peace.

## [3.15 Hārita](../thag3.15/)

Whoever wishes to do afterwards  
What they should have done before,  
They’ve lost the causes for happiness,  
And afterwards they’re tormented with remorse.  

You should only say what you would do;  
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.  
The wise will recognize  
One who talks without doing.  

Oh! nibbāna is so very blissful,  
As taught by the Buddha:  
Sorrowless, stainless, secure;  
Where suffering all ceases.

## [3.16 Vimala](../thag3.16/)

Avoiding bad friends,  
You should associate with the best of people.  
Stick to the advice that he gave you,  
Aspiring for unshakable happiness.  

If someone lost in the middle of the ocean,  
Were to clamber up on a little log, they’d sink;  
In the same way, even a good person would sink  
If they rely on a lazy person.  

So avoid those who are lazy, lacking energy.  
Instead, dwell with the wise—  
Secluded, noble,  
Resolute, practising jhāna,  
And always energetic.
