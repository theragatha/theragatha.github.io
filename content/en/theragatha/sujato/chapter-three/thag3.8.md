# 3.8 Vassika

I was the only one in my family  
Who had faith and wisdom.  
It’s good for my relatives that I’m  
Firm in Dhamma, and my conduct is virtuous.  

I rebuked my family out of compassion,  
Reprimanding them because of my love  
For my family and relatives.  

They performed a service for the monks  
And then they passed away,  
To find happiness in the heaven of the Thirty-three.  
There, my brothers and mother rejoice  
With all the pleasures they desire.
