## 3.10 Sāṭimattiya  

In the past you had faith,  
Today you have none.  
What’s yours is yours alone;  
I’ve done nothing wrong.  

Faith is impermanent, fickle—  
So I have seen.  
People’s passions wax and wane:  
Why should a sage grow old worrying about that?  

The meal of a sage is cooked  
Bit by bit, in this family or that.  
I’ll walk for alms,  
For my legs are strong.
