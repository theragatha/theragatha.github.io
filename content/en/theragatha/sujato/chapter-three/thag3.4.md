## 3.4 Dhaniya  

One who hopes for the ascetic life,  
Wishing to live in happiness,  
Should not look down on the Saṅgha’s robe,  
Or its food and drinks.  

One who hopes for the ascetic life,  
Wishing to live in happiness,  
Should stay in the Saṅgha’s lodgings,  
Like a snake in a mouse hole.  

One who hopes for the ascetic life,  
Wishing to live in happiness,  
Should be satisfied with whatever is offered,  
Developing this one quality.
