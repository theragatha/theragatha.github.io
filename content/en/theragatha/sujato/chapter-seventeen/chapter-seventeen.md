# Chapter Seventeen

## 17.1 Phussa  

Seeing many who inspire confidence,  
Personally developed and well-restrained,  
The sage Paṇḍarasagotta  
Asked the one known as Phussa:  

“In future times,  
What desire and motivation  
And behaviour will people have?  
Please answer my question.”  

“Listen to my words  
O sage known as Paṇḍarasa:  
And remember them carefully,  
I will describe the future.  

In the future many will be  
Angry and hostile,  
Denigrating, stubborn, and treacherous,  
Envious, and holding divergent views.  

Thinking they understand the profundity of the Dhamma,  
They remain on the near shore.  
Superficial and disrespectful towards the Dhamma,  
They have no respect for one another.  

In the future,  
Many dangers will arise in the world.  
Fools will defile  
The Dhamma that has been taught so well.  

Though lacking good qualities,  
The incompetent, the talkative,  
And the unlearned,  
Will be powerful in Saṅgha proceedings.  

Though possessing good qualities,  
The competent, the conscientious,  
And the unbiased,  
Will be weak in Saṅgha proceedings.  

In the future, fools will accept  
Gold and silver,  
Fields and property, goats and sheep,  
And male and female bonded servants.  

Fools looking to find fault in others,  
But bereft of virtues themselves,  
Will wander about, insolent,  
Like cantankerous beasts.  

They’ll be arrogant,  
Wrapped in robes of blue;  
Deceitful, obstinate, chatty, caustic,  
They’ll wander as if they were noble ones.  

With hair sleeked back with oil,  
Fickle, their eyes painted with eye-liner,  
They’ll travel on the high-road,  
Wrapped in robes of ivory color.  

They’ll love white clothes,  
And they’ll detest the deep-dyed ochre robe,  
The banner of the arahants,  
Which is worn without disgust by the free.  

They’ll want lots of things,  
And be lazy, lacking energy;  
Weary of the forest,  
They’ll stay in villages.  

Being unrestrained, they’ll keep company with  
Those who obtain lots of things,  
And who always enjoy wrong livelihood,  
Following their example.  

They won’t respect those  
Who don’t obtain lots of things,  
And they won’t associate with the wise,  
Even though they’re very amiable.  

Disparaging their own banner,  
Which is dyed the colour of copper,  
Some will wear the white banner  
Of the followers of other religions.  

Then they’ll have no respect  
For the ochre robe;  
The monks will not reflect  
On the nature of the ochre robe.  

This awful lack of reflection  
Was unthinkable to the elephant,  
Who was overcome by suffering,  
Pierced by an arrow, and injured.  

Then the six-tusked elephant,  
Seeing the deep-coloured banner of the arahants,  
Straight away spoke these verses  
Connected with the goal.  

The impure one  
Who will wear the ochre robe  
Without taming and truth,  
Isn’t worthy of the ochre robe.  

Whoever has rejected impurities,  
Endowed with virtues,  
Possessing truth and taming,  
They are truly worthy of the ochre robe.  

Devoid of virtue, unintelligent,  
Wild, doing what they like,  
Their minds all over the place, indolent  
They are not worthy of the ochre robe.  

Whoever is endowed with virtue,  
Free of lust, possessing samādhi,  
Their heart’s intention pure,  
They are truly worthy of the ochre robe.  

The conceited, arrogant fool,  
Who has no virtue,  
Is worthy of a white robe—  
What use is an ochre robe for them?  

In the future, monks and nuns  
With corrupt hearts, disrespectful,  
Will disparage those  
With hearts of loving-kindness.  

Though trained in wearing the robe  
By senior monks,  
The unintelligent will not listen,  
Wild, doing what they like.  

With that kind of attitude to training,  
Those fools won’t respect each another,  
Or take any notice of their mentors,  
Like a wild horse with its charioteer.  

So, in the future,  
This will be the practice  
Of monks and nuns,  
When the latter days have come.  

Before this terrifying future arrives,  
Be easy to admonish,  
Kind in speech,  
And respect one another.  

Have hearts of loving-kindness and compassion,  
And keep your precepts;  
Be energetic, resolute,  
And always strong in exertion.  

Seeing heedlessness as fearful,  
And heedfulness as security,  
Develop the eight-fold path,  
Realising the deathless state.”  

## 17.2 Sāriputta  

“A mindful person is like one of good conduct,  
Or like one who is peaceful;  
A heedful person is like one of good intentions,  
Who is practicing jhāna;  
Happy inside, possessing samādhi,  
Solitary, contented; that is what they call a monk.  

When eating fresh or dried food,  
One shouldn’t be overly satisfied.  
A monk should wander mindfully,  
With unfilled belly, taking limited food.  

Four or five mouthfuls before you’re full,  
Drink some water;  
This is enough to live comfortably  
For a resolute monk.  

Covered by a suitable robe,  
Which is for this purpose;  
This is enough to live comfortably  
For a resolute monk.  

When sitting cross-legged,  
The rain doesn’t fall on the knees;  
This is enough to live comfortably  
For a resolute monk.  

When you’ve seen happiness as suffering,  
And suffering as a dart,  
You know there’s no difference between them—  
With what are you bound to the world?  
What would you become?  

When you think, ‘May I not associate  
With people of bad wishes,  
Lazy, lacking energy,  
With little learning, disrespectful’—  
With what are you bound to the world?  
What would you become?  

A wise person who is learned,  
Endowed with virtues,  
Devoted to serenity of heart—  
Let them stand at the head.  

Whoever is devoted to proliferation,  
A wild animal delighting in proliferation,  
Is deprived of nibbāna,  
The unexcelled safety from the yoke.  

Whoever has given up proliferation,  
Delighting in the path free of proliferation,  
Is blessed with nibbāna,  
The unexcelled safety from the yoke.  

Whether in the village or in the wilderness,  
In lands low or high,  
Wherever arahants live  
Is a delightful place.  

The wilderness is delightful!  
Where most people find no delight,  
Those who are free of lust delight there,  
As they are not seeking sensual pleasures. 

When you see someone who sees your faults,  
A wise person who rebukes you,  
You should stick close to such an intelligent person,  
As if they were revealing some hidden treasure.  
Sticking close to such a person,  
Things get better, not worse.  

You should advise, you should admonish;  
You should curb rudeness;  
For such a person is loved by the mindful,  
Not loved by the unmindful.  

The Blessed One, the Buddha, the seer  
Was teaching Dhamma to another.  
While Dhamma was being taught  
I listened attentively, to understand the meaning—  
My listening wasn’t wasted,  
I’m liberated, without defilements.  

Not for knowledge of past lives,  
Nor even for clairvoyance;  
Not for psychic powers,  
Or reading the minds of others,  
Nor for knowing people’s passing away  
And being reborn;  
Not for purifying the power of clairaudience,  
Did I have any resolve.”  

“His only shelter is at the foot of a tree;  
With shaved head, wrapped in the outer robe,  
The senior monk who is foremost in wisdom,  
Upatissa himself practices jhāna.  

Entering a meditation state without thought,  
A disciple of the Buddha  
Is at that moment blessed  
With noble silence.  

Just like a rocky mountain  
Is unshakable and firmly grounded;  
So when delusion ends,  
A monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.”  

“To the blameless man  
Who is always seeking purity,  
Even a hair-tip of evil  
Seems the size of a cloud.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I will lay down this body,  
Aware and mindful.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Like a worker waiting for their wages.”  

“Both before and after  
It’s death, not the deathless,  
Practice, don’t perish—  
Don’t let the moment pass you by.  

Just like a frontier city,  
Guarded inside and out,  
So you should ward yourselves  
Don’t let the moment pass you by.  
Those who pass up the moment  
Grieve when they end up in hell.”  

“Calm and quiet,  
Wise in counsel, not restless;  
He shakes off bad qualities  
As the wind shakes leaves off a tree.  

Calm and quiet,  
Wise in counsel, not restless;  
He plucks off bad qualities  
As the wind plucks leaves off a tree.  

Calm and sorrowless,  
Clear and undisturbed,  
Of good virtue and intelligent:  
You should put an end to suffering.”  

“Some householders,  
And even some of those gone forth,  
Are not to be trusted.  
Even some who were good later become bad;  
While some who were bad become good.  

Sensual desire, ill-will,  
Dullness and drowsiness,  
Restlessness, and doubt:  
These are the five mental stains for a monk.  

Whoever’s samādhi does not waver,  
Regardless of whether or not  
They receive honours,  
Is one who lives heedfully.  

They regularly practice jhāna,  
With subtle insight into views;  
Delighting in the end of grasping,  
They are said to be a good person.  

Ocean, earth,  
Mountains, wind—  
These cannot compare  
With the teacher’s magnificent liberation.  

He is the senior monk who keeps  
The Wheel of Dhamma rolling,  
Possessing great knowledge and samādhi.  
Like earth, like water, like fire,  
He is neither attracted nor repelled.  

He has attained the perfection of wisdom,  
He has great intelligence and great discernment;  
He is not stupid, but appears stupid;  
He always wanders, quenched.  

I’ve attended on the teacher  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence.  

Strive on with heedfulness:  
This is my advice.  
Come, now I’ll realise nibbāna,  
I am liberated in every way.”

## 17.3 Ānanda  

“A wise person would not make friends  
With a slanderous or hostile person,  
With a miser, or one who delights  
In the misfortunes of others;  
Association with a bad person is harmful.  

The wise would make friends  
With the faithful, the pleasant,  
Those with understanding, who are learned;  
Association with a good person is blessed.  

See this fancy puppet,  
A heap of sores, a composite body,  
Diseased, obsessed over,  
Having no lasting stability.  

See this fancy shape,  
With its gems and earrings;  
It is bones wrapped with skin,  
Made pretty by its clothes.  

Rouged feet  
And powdered face  
Is enough to delude a fool,  
But not a seeker of the far shore.  

Hair in eight braids  
And eyeliner applied,  
Is enough to delude a fool,  
But not a seeker of the far shore.  

Like a newly decorated make-up box,  
The disgusting body all adorned  
Is enough to delude a fool,  
But not a seeker of the far shore.  

Gotama is learned, a brilliant speaker,  
The attendant to the Buddha.  
Unfettered, with burden put aside,  
He lies down to sleep.  

Unfettered, his defilements have ended,  
He has transcended attachments,  
And has attained nibbāna.  
He bears his final body,  
Gone beyond birth and death.  

Gotama, in whom the teachings of the Buddha,  
The Kinsman of the Sun, are established,  
Stands on the path  
Leading to nibbāna.  

I learned 82,000 from the Buddha,  
And 2,000 from the monks;  
These 84,000  
Are the teachings I have memorized.  

A person of little learning  
Ages like an ox—  
Their flesh grows,  
But their wisdom doesn’t.  

A learned person who, on account of their learning,  
Looks down on someone of little learning,  
Seems to me like  
A blind man holding a lamp.  

You should stay close to a learned person—  
Don’t lose what you’ve learned.  
It is the root of the spiritual life,  
So you should memorize the Dhamma.  

Knowing the sequence  
And meaning of the teaching,  
Skilled in the interpretation of terms,  
He makes sure it is well memorized,  
And then examines the meaning.  

Accepting the teachings, he becomes enthusiastic;  
Making an effort, he scrutinizes the Dhamma;  
Striving at the right time,  
He is serene inside himself.  

If you want to understand the Dhamma,  
You should associate with the sort of person  
Who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,  
A wise disciple of the Buddha.  

A monk who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,  
A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,  
Is a visionary for the entire world,  
Venerable, and learned.  

Delighting in Dhamma, enjoying Dhamma,  
Reflecting on Dhamma,  
Recollecting Dhamma,  
He doesn’t decline in the true Dhamma.  

When your body is pampered and heavy,  
While your remaining time is running out;  
Greedy for physical pleasure,  
How can you find happiness as an ascetic?  

Every direction is unclear!  
The Dhamma does not occur to me!  
With the passing of our good friend,  
It all seems dark.  

If your friend has passed away,  
And your teacher is past and gone,  
There’s no friend like  
Mindfulness of the body.  

The old have passed away,  
And I don’t get on with the new.  
Today I meditate alone  
Like a bird snug in its nest.”  

“Many international visitors  
Have come to see.  
Don’t block the audience,  
Let the congregation see me.”  

“Lots of international visitors  
Have come to see.  
The teacher grants them the opportunity,  
The seer doesn’t stop them.  

For the 25 years  
Since I have been a trainee,  
No sensual perception arose in me:  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  

For the 25 years  
Since I have been a trainee,  
No malicious perception arose in me:  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  

For 25 years  
I attended on the Blessed One  
With loving deeds,  
Like a shadow that never left.  

For 25 years  
I attended on the Blessed One  
With loving words,  
Like a shadow that never left.  

For 25 years  
I attended on the Blessed One  
With loving thoughts,  
Like a shadow that never left.  

While the Buddha was walking meditation,  
I walked meditation behind him.  
As he taught the Dhamma,  
Knowledge arose in me.  

I’m a trainee, who has more to do!  
My mind is not perfected!  
Yet the teacher, who was so compassionate to me,  
Has passed into nibbāna.  

Then there was terror!  
Then they had goose-bumps!  
When the Buddha, endowed with all qualities,  
Passed into nibbāna.”  

“Ānanda, who was learned,  
And had memorized the Dhamma,  
A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,  
A visionary for the entire world,  
Has passed into nibbāna.  

He was learned, and had memorized the Dhamma,  
A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,  
A visionary for the entire world,  
When all was black, he dispelled the dark.  

He is the sage who remembered the teachings,  
And mastered their sequence, holding them firm.  
The senior monk who memorized the Dhamma,  
Ānanda was a mine of gems.”  

“I’ve attended on the teacher  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  
The heavy burden is laid down,  
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn  
In any state of existence.”
