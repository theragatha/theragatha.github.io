# Chapter Twelve

# 12.1 Sīlava  

One should train just in virtue,  
For in this world, when virtue is  
Cultivated and well-trained,  
It provides all success.  

Desiring three kinds of happiness—  
Praise, prosperity,  
And to delight in heaven after passing away—  
The wise should protect virtue.  

The well-behaved have many friends,  
Because of their self-restraint.  
But one without virtue, of bad conduct,  
Drives away their friends.  

A person of bad behavior has  
Ill-repute and infamy.  
A person of virtue always has  
A good reputation, fame, and praise.  

Virtue is the starting point and foundation;  
The mother at the head  
Of all good qualities:  
Therefore you should purify virtue.  

Virtue is a boundary and a restraint,  
An enjoyment for the mind;  
The place where all the Buddhas cross over:  
Therefore you should purify virtue.  

Virtue is the matchless power;  
Virtue is the ultimate weapon;  
Virtue is the best ornament;  
Virtue is a marvellous coat of armour.  

Virtue is a mighty bridge;  
Virtue is the unsurpassed scent;  
Virtue is the best perfume,  
That floats in all directions.  

Virtue is the best provision;  
Virtue is the unsurpassed supply for a journey;  
Virtue is the best vehicle,  
That takes you in all directions.  

In this life they’re criticized;  
After passing away they’re unhappy in a lower realm;  
A fool is unhappy everywhere,  
Because they are not endowed with virtues.  

In this life they’re famous;  
After passing away they’re happy in heaven;  
A person with understanding is happy everywhere,  
Because they are endowed with virtues.  

Virtue is best in this life,  
But a person with understanding is supreme  
Among humans and gods,  
Conquering with virtue and understanding.  


## 12.2 Sunīta  

I was born in a low-class family,  
Poor, with little to eat.  
My job was lowly—  
I threw out the old flowers.  

Shunned by people,  
I was disregarded and treated with contempt.  
I humbled my heart,  
And paid respects to many people.  

Then I saw the Buddha,  
Honoured by the Saṅgha of monks,  
The great hero,  
Entering the capital city of Magadhā.  

I dropped my carrying-pole  
And approached to pay respects.  
Out of compassion for me,  
The supreme man stood still.  

When I had paid respects at the teacher’s feet,  
I stood to one side,  
And asked the most excellent of all beings  
For the going-forth.  

Then the teacher, being sympathetic,  
And having compassion for the whole world,  
Said to me, “Come, monk!”  
That was my full ordination.  

Staying alone in the wilderness,  
Without laziness,  
I did what the teacher said,  
As the conqueror had advised me.  

In the first watch of the night,  
I recollected my previous births.  
In the middle watch of the night,  
I purified my clairvoyance.  
In the last watch of the night,  
I tore apart the mass of darkness.  

At the end of the night,  
As the sunrise drew near,  
Indra and Brahmā came  
And paid homage to me with hands in añjalī.  

“Homage to you, thoroughbred among men!  
Homage to you, supreme among men!  
Your defilements are ended—  
You, sir, are worthy of offerings.”  

When he saw me honored  
By the assembly of gods,  
The teacher smiled,  
And said the following:  

“By austerity and by the holy life,  
By restraint and by taming:  
By this one is a holy man,  
This is the supreme holiness.”
