# Chapter Nine

## 9.1 Bhūta  

When a wise person fully understands  
That old age and death—  
To which an ignorant unawakened person is bound—  
Are suffering; and they are mindful, practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When attachment, the carrier of suffering,  
And craving, the carrier of the suffering  
Of this mass of proliferation,  
Are destroyed; and they are mindful, practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When the blissful eightfold way,  
The supreme path, cleanser of all stains,  
Is seen with wisdom;  
And they are mindful, practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When one develops that peaceful state,  
Sorrowless, stainless, unconditioned,  
Cleanser of all stains,  
And cutter of fetters and bonds:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When the thunder-cloud rumbles in the sky,  
And the rain falls in torrents  
On the path of birds everywhere,  
And a monk has gone to a mountain cave,  
Practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When sitting on a riverbank covered in flowers,  
Garlanded with many-coloured forest plants  
One is truly happy, practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When it is midnight in a lonely forest,  
And the sky rains, and the lions roar,  
And a monk has gone to a mountain cave,  
Practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When one’s own thoughts have stopped,  
Meditating between two mountains,  
Sheltered inside a cleft,  
Without stress or heartlessness, practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.  

When one is happy, destroyer of stains,  
Heartlessness, and sorrow,  
Without obstructions, entanglements, and darts,  
And with all defilements annihilated, practising jhāna:  
There is no greater pleasure than this.
