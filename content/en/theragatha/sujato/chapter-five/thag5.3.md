# 5.3 Girimānanda  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there peacefully—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, with peaceful mind—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, free of lust—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, free of hate—  
So rain, sky, as you please.  

The sky rains, like a beautiful song,  
My little hut is roofed and pleasant,  
Sheltered from the wind,  
I dwell there, free of delusion—  
So rain, sky, as you please.
