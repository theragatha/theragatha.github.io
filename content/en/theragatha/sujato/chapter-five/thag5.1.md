# 5.1 Rājadatta

I, a monk, went to a charnel ground  
And saw a woman left there,  
Discarded in a cemetery,  
Full of worms that devoured her.  

Some men were disgusted,  
Seeing her dead and rotten;  
But sexual desire arose in me,  
I was as if blind to her oozing body.  

Quicker than the boiling of rice  
I left that place,  
Mindful and aware,  
I sat down to one side.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
