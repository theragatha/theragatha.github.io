# 5.8 Vakkali  

“Struck by a wind ailment,  
While staying in a forest grove;  
You’ve gone into a tough place for gathering alms:  
How will you get by, monk?”  

“Pervading my body  
With lots of rapture and happiness,  
Putting up with what’s tough,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.  

Developing the establishments of mindfulness,  
The faculties and the powers,  
Developing the factors of awakening,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.  

Having seen those who are energetic, resolute,  
Always of strong effort,  
Harmonious and serene,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.  

Recollecting the Buddha,  
The highest, the tamed, who has samādhi;  
Not lazy by day or by night,  
I’ll dwell in the forest.”
