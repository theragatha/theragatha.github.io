# 5.6 Nadīkassapa  

It was truly for my benefit  
That the Buddha went to the river Nerañjara;  
When I heard his teaching,  
I rejected wrong view.  

Previously, I performed the higher  
And lower sacrifices;  
I worshipped the sacred flame,  
Thinking, “This is purity.”  
I was a blind, unenlightened person.  

Caught in the thicket of wrong view,  
Deluded by misapprehension;  
Thinking impurity was purity,  
I was blind and ignorant.  

I’ve abandoned wrong view,  
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,  
I worship what is truly worthy of offerings:  
I bow to the Tathāgata.  

I’ve abandoned all delusion,  
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,  
Transmigration through births is finished,  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.
