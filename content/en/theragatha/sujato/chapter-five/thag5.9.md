# 5.9 Vijitasena  

I’ll cage you, mind,  
Like an elephant in a stockade.  
Born of the flesh, that net of sensual pleasures,  
I won’t urge you to do bad.  

Caged, you won’t escape,  
Like an elephant who can’t find an open gate.  
Demon-mind, you won’t wander again and again,  
Bullying, and loving to do bad.  

Just as a strong trainer with a hook,  
Takes a wild, newly captured elephant  
And wins it over against its will,  
So I’ll win you over.  

Just as a fine charioteer,  
Skilled in the taming of fine horses,  
Tames a thoroughbred,  
So, firmly established in the five powers,  
I’ll tame you.  

I’ll bind you with mindfulness,  
I’m committed to taming you;  
Restrained by harnessed energy,  
Mind, you won’t go far from here.
