# 5.2 Subhūta  

If a person, wishing for a certain outcome,  
Applies themselves to a misguided endeavor,  
And they don’t achieve what they have practiced for,  
They say: “That’s a sign of my bad luck.”  

When a misfortune  
Has been plucked out and conquered,  
To give it up in part would be like  
The losing throw of the dice;  
But to give up everything  
Would be as if one was blind,  
Not discerning the even and the uneven.  

You should only say what you would do;  
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.  
The wise will recognize  
One who talks without doing.  

Just like a glorious flower  
That’s colourful but lacks fragrance;  
So is well-spoken speech fruitless  
For one not acting in accordance.  

Just like a glorious flower  
Is both colourful and fragrant,  
So is well-spoken speech fruitful  
For one who acts in accordance.
