# 5.5 Vaḍḍha  

It was good, how my mother  
Spurred me onwards.  
When I heard her words,  
Advised by my mother,  
I became energetic, resolute—  
I realised supreme awakening.  

I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,  
With the three knowledges  
And the vision of the deathless;  
I conquered Namuci’s army,  
And now I live without defilements.  

The defilements which I had,  
Both internally and externally,  
Are now all cut off without remainder;  
They won’t arise again.  

My skilful sister  
Said this to me:  
“Now neither you nor I  
Have any entanglements.”  

Suffering is at an end;  
This is the last body  
To transmigrate through birth and death:  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence.
