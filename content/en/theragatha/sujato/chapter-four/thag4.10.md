# 4.10 Dhammika  

“Dhamma really protects you if you practice Dhamma;  
Dhamma well-practiced brings happiness.  
If you practice Dhamma, this is the benefit—  
You won’t go to a bad destination.  

Dhamma and what is not Dhamma  
Don’t both lead to the same results.  
What is not Dhamma leads to hell,  
While Dhamma takes you to a good destination.  

So you should be enthusiastic  
To perform acts of Dhamma,  
Rejoicing in the Fortunate One, the poised.  
Disciples of the best of Fortunate Ones  
Are firm in Dhamma;  
Those wise ones are led on,  
Going to the very best of refuges.”  

“The boil has been burst from its root,  
The net of craving is undone.  
He has ended transmigration, he has nothing,  
Just like the full moon in a clear night sky.”
