# 4.12 Mudita  

I went forth to save my life;  
But I gained faith  
After receiving full ordination;  
And I strove, strong in effort.  

With pleasure, let this body be broken!  
Let this lump of flesh be dissolved!  
Let both my legs fall off  
At the knees!  

I won’t eat, I won’t drink,  
I won’t leave my dwelling,  
Nor will I lie down on my side,  
Until the dart of craving is drawn out.  

As I dwell like this,  
See my energy and striving!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
