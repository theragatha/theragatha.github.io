# 4.5 Jambuka  

For fifty-five years  
I wore mud and dirt;  
Eating one meal a month,  
I tore out my hair and beard.  

I stood on one foot;  
I rejected seats;  
I ate dried-out dung;  
I didn’t accept food that had been set aside for me.  

Having done many actions of this kind,  
Which lead to a bad destination,  
As I was being swept away by the great flood,  
I went to the Buddha for refuge.  

See the going for refuge!  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
