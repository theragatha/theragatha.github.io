# 4.9 Candana  

Covered with gold,  
Surrounded by all her maids,  
With my son upon her hip,  
My wife came up to me.  

I saw her coming,  
The mother of my son,  
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,  
Like a snare of death laid down.  

Then the realization  
Came upon me—  
The danger became clear,  
And I was firmly repulsed.  

Then my mind was liberated—  
See the excellence of the Dhamma!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
