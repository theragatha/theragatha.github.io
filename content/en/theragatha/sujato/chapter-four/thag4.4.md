# 4.4 Nandaka  

Damn these stinking bodies!  
They’re on Māra’s side, they ooze;  
And bodies have nine streams  
That are always flowing.  

Don’t think much of bodies;  
Don’t disparage the Tathāgathas.  
They’re not even aroused by heaven,  
Let alone by humans.  

But those dumb fools,  
With bad advisors, shrouded in delusion,  
That kind of person is aroused by bodies,  
When Māra has thrown the snare.  

Those who have discarded  
Lust, hatred, and ignorance:  
They’ve cut the strings, they’re no longer bound—  
Such people are not aroused by bodies.
