## 2.41  Kumārakassapa

Oh, the Buddhas! Oh, the Dhammas!
Oh, the perfections of the Teacher!
Where a disciple may see
Such a Dhamma for themselves.

Through countless aeons
They obtained an identity;
This is the end,
Their last body;
Transmigrating through births and deaths,
Now there is no more rebirth
Into any state of existence.
