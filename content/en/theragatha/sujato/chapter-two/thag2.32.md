## 2.32 Sivaka

All houses are impermanent;  
Again and again, in all kinds of realms,  
54 verses of senior monks  
I’ve searched for the house-builder—  
Rebirth again and again is suffering.  

I’ve seen you, house-builder!  
You won’t build a house again.  
All your rafters are broken,  
Your ridgepole is split.  
My mind is released from limits:  
It’ll fall apart in this very life.
