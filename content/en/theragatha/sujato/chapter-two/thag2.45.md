## 2.45 Visākhapañcālaputta

One should not suspend others from the Saṅgha,  
Nor raise objections against them;  
And neither disparage nor raise one’s voice  
Against one who has crossed to the further shore.  
One should not praise oneself among the assemblies,  
But be without conceit, measured in speech,  
And of good conduct.  

For one who sees the goal, so very subtle and fine,  
Who has wholesome thoughts and humbleness,  
And cultivates the Buddha’s ethical conduct,  
It’s not hard to gain nibbāna.
