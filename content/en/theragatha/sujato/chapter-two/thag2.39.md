## 2.39 Usabha

I arranged a robe on my shoulder,  
The colour of young mango sprouts;  
Then I entered the village for alms,  
While sitting on an elephant’s neck!  

But when I dismounted from the elephant,  
I was moved by inspiration—  
At first I was burning, but then I was peaceful;  
I realized the end of defilements.
