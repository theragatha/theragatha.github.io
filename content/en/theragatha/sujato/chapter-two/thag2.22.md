## 2.22  Bhaddaji

That king was named Panāda,  
Whose sacrificial post was golden.  
Its height was sixteen times its width,  
And the top was a thousand-fold.  

With a thousand panels, and a hundred ball-caps,  
Adorned with banners, made of gold;  
There, the seven times six hundred  
Gods of music danced.
