## 2.44 Mogharāja

“Your skin is nasty but your heart is good,  
Mogharāja, you always have samādhi.  
But in the nights of winter, so dark and cold,  
How will you get by, monk?”  

I’ve heard that all the Magadhans  
Have an abundance of grain.  
I’ll make my bed under a thatched roof,  
Just like those who live in comfort.”
