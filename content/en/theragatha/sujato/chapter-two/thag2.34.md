## 2.34  Isidinna

I’ve seen lay disciples who have memorized discourses,
Saying “Sensual pleasures are impermanent”;
But they are passionately enamoured
Of jewelled earrings,
Desiring children and wives.

To be honest, they don’t know Dhamma,
Despite saying “Sensual pleasures are impermanent”;
They don’t have the power to cut their lust,
So they’re attached to children, wives, and wealth.
