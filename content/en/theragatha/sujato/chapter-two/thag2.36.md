## 2.36  Nitaka

Whose mind is like rock,  
Steady, not trembling?  
Free of desire among desirable things,  
Not agitated among agitating things?  
For one whose mind is developed in this way,  
From where will suffering come?  

My mind is like rock,  
Steady, not trembling,  
Free of desire among desirable things,  
Not agitated among agitating things.  
For me, whose mind is developed in this way,  
From where will suffering come?
