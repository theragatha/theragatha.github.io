## 2.47 Anūpama

The conceited mind, addicted to pleasure,  
Impales itself on its own stake.  
It goes only where  
There’s a stake, a chopping block.  

I declare you the demon mind!  
I declare you the insidious mind!  
You’ve found the teacher so hard to find—  
Don’t lead me away from the goal.
