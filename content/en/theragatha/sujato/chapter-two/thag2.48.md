## 2.48 Vajjita

Transmigrating for such a long time,  
I’ve evolved through various states of rebirth,  
Not seeing the noble truths,  
A blind, unenlightened person.  

But when I became heedful  
Transmigrating from birth to birth was disintegrated;  
All states of rebirth were cut off;  
Now there is no more rebirth  
Into any state of existence
