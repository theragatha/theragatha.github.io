## 2.38 Nisabha

One who has gone forth  
From the home life out of faith,  
Leaving behind the five kinds of sensual pleasures,  
So pleasant seeming, delighting the mind—  
Let them put an end to suffering.  

I don’t long for death;  
I don’t long for life;  
I await my time,  
Aware and mindful.
