## 2.43 Brahmāli

Whose faculties have become serene,  
Like horses tamed by a charioteer?  
Who has abandoned conceit and defilements,  
Becoming such that even the gods envy them?  

My faculties have become serene,  
Like horses tamed by a charioteer?  
I have abandoned conceit and defilements,  
Becoming such that even the gods envy me.
