## 2.14 Somamitta  

If someone lost in the middle of the ocean,  
Were to clamber up on a little log, they’d sink;  
In the same way, even a good person would sink  
If they rely on a lazy person.  
So avoid those who are lazy, lacking energy.  

Instead, dwell with the wise—  
Secluded, noble,  
Resolute, practising jhāna,  
And always energetic.
