## 2.35 Sambulakaccāna

The sky rains, the sky groans,  
I’m staying alone in a frightful hole.  
But while I’m staying alone in that frightful hole,  
I’ve no fear, no dread, no goosebumps.  

This is my normal state,  
When I’m staying alone in a frightful hole:  
I’ve no fear, no dread, no goosebumps.
