## 2.37  Soṇapoṭiriya

Night, with its garland of stars,  
Is not just for sleeping.  
Those who are conscious will know  
That night is also for waking.  

If I were to fall from the back of an elephant  
And be trampled by the tuskers that follow,  
Better for me to die in battle,  
Than to live on in defeat.
