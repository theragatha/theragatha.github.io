## 2.33 Upavāṇa

The Worthy One, the world’s Holy One  
The sage is afflicted by winds.  
If there’s hot water,  
Give it to the sage, brahmin.  

I wish to bring it to the one  
Who is honoured by those worthy of honour,  
Revered by those worthy of reverence,  
And respected by those worthy of respect.
