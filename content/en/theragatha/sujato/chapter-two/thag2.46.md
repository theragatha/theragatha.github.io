## 2.46 Cūḷaka

The peacocks cry out  
With their fair crests and tails,  
Their lovely blue necks and fair faces,  
Their beautiful song and their call.  
This broad earth is lush with grass and dew,  
And the sky’s full of beautiful clouds.  

A person who is practising jhāna is happy in mind,  
And their appearance is uplifting;  
Going forth in the teaching of the Buddha  
Is easy for a good person.  
You should realise that supreme, unchanging state,  
So very pure, subtle, and hard to see.
