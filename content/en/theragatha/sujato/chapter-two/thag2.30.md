## 2.30  Kaṇhadinna

I sat close by wise people,  
And learnt the Dhamma many times.  
What I learnt, I practiced,  
Entering the road that culminates in the deathless.  

I’ve slain the desire to be reborn  
In any state of existence,  
Such desire won’t be found in me again.  
It was not, and it won’t be in me,  
And it isn’t found in me now.
