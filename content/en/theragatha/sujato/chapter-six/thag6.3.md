# 6.3 Mahānāga  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Falls away from the true Dhamma,  
Like a fish in too little water.  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Doesn’t thrive in the true Dhamma,  
Like a rotten seed in a field.  

Whoever has no respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Is far from nibbāna,  
In the teaching of the Dhamma king.  

Whoever does have respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Doesn’t fall away from the true Dhamma,  
Like a fish in plenty of water.  

Whoever does have respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Thrives in the true Dhamma,  
Like a quality seed in a field.  

Whoever does have respect  
For their companions in the spiritual life  
Is close to nibbāna,  
In the teaching of the Dhamma king.
