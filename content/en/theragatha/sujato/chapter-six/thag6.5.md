# 6.5 Mālukyaputta  

For a person who lives heedlessly,  
Craving grows like a parasitic creeper.  
They jump from here to there, like a monkey  
That wants fruit in a forest grove.  

Whoever is overcome by this wretched craving,  
This attachment to the world,  
Their sorrow grows,  
Like grass in the rain.  

But whoever overcomes this wretched craving,  
This attachment to the world,  
Their sorrows fall from them,  
Like a water-drop from a lotus.  

I say this to you, venerables,  
All those who have gathered here:  
Dig up the root of craving,  
Like someone who is looking for roots  
Will dig up the grass.  
Don’t let Māra break you again and again,  
Like a stream breaking a reed.  

Act on the Buddha’s words,  
Don’t let the moment pass you by.  
Those who pass up the moment  
Grieve when they end up in hell.  

Heedlessness is always an impurity,  
Impurity comes from heedlessness.  
With heedfulness and knowledge,  
Pluck out your own dart.
