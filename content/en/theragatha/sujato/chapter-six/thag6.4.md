# 6.4 Kulla  

I, Kulla, went to a charnel ground  
And saw a woman left there,  
Discarded in a cemetery,  
Full of worms that devoured her.  

See this body, Kulla—  
Diseased, filthy, rotten,  
Oozing and trickling,  
A fools’ delight.  

Taking Dhamma as a mirror  
For realizing knowledge and vision,  
I reviewed this body,  
Vacant, inside and out.  

As this is, so is that;  
As that is, so is this.  
As below, so above;  
As above, so below.  

As by day, so by night;  
As by night, so by day.  
As before, so after;  
As after, so before.  

Not even music played by a five-piece band,  
Can give such pleasure  
As there is for one with unified mind,  
Discerning the Dhamma rightly.
