# 6.1 Uruveḷakassapa  

When I saw the marvels  
Of the renowned Gotama,  
I didn’t immediately bow to him;  
I was blinded by jealousy and conceit.  

Knowing what I was thinking,  
The trainer of men spurred me on;  
And I was struck with a marvellous inspiration,  
That gave me goose-bumps.  

Rejecting my petty accomplishments  
When I used to be a matted-hair ascetic,  
I then went forth,  
In the conqueror’s teaching.  

I used to be content with sacrifice,  
Giving priority to the realm of sensual pleasures,  
But later I uprooted desire,  
And hatred and also delusion.  

I know my past life;  
My clairvoyance is clarified;  
I have psychic powers,  
And I know the minds of others;  
I have realised the divine ear.  

I’ve attained the goal  
For the sake of which I went forth  
From home life into homelessness—  
The ending of all fetters.
