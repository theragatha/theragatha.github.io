# 7.3 Bhadda  

I was an only child,  
Loved by my mother and father.  
They had me by practising  
Many prayers and observances.  

Out of compassion,  
Wishing me well and seeking my welfare,  
My mother and father  
Took me up to the Buddha.  

“We had this son with difficulty;  
He is delicate, and has grown up in comfort.  
We offer him to you, Lord,  
To attend upon the conqueror.”  

The teacher, having accepted me,  
Declared to Ānanda:  
“Quickly give him the going-forth—  
This one will be a thoroughbred.”  

After he, the teacher, had sent me forth,  
The conqueror entered his dwelling.  
Before the sun set,  
My mind was liberated.  

The teacher didn’t neglect me;  
When he came out from seclusion,  
He said: “Come Bhadda!”  
That was my full ordination.  

At seven years old  
I received full ordination.  
I’ve attained the three knowledges;  
Oh, the excellence of the Dhamma!
