# 16.7 Kāḷigodhāputtabhaddiya

I rode on an elephant’s neck,
Wearing delicate clothes.
I ate rice conjey
With pure meat sauce.

Today I am fortunate, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Practices jhāna without grasping.

Wearing rags, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;

Practices jhāna without grasping.

Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;

Practices jhāna without grasping.

Possessing only three robes, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Practices jhāna without grasping.

Going on alms-round from house to house
Without exception, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Practices jhāna without grasping.

Sitting alone, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Practices jhāna without grasping.

Eating only what is placed in the alms-bowl,
Persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;

Never eating too late, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;

Practices jhāna without grasping.

Living in the wilderness, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;

Practices jhāna without grasping.

Not lying down to sleep, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Practices jhāna without grasping.

Having few wishes, persevering,
Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Practices jhāna without grasping.

Happy with the scraps in my alms-bowl;

Giving up a valuable bronze bowl,
And a precious golden one, too,
I took up a clay bowl:
This is my second initiation.

Formerly I lived in a citadel
Surrounded by high walls,
With strong battlements and gates,
And guarded by swordsmen—
And I trembled with fear.

Today I am fortunate, free of trembling,
With fear and dread abandoned.
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Has plunged into the forest and practices jhāna.

Established in all the practices of virtue,
Developing mindfulness and understanding,
Gradually I attained
The end of all fetters.
