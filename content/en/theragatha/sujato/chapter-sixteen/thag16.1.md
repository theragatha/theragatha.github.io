# 16.1 Adhimutta

“Those that we previously killed,
Whether for sacrifice or for wealth,
Without exception were afraid:
They trembled and squealed.

But you aren’t frightened;
Your appearance is becoming more calm:
Why don’t you cry out
In such a fearful situation?”

“There isn’t any mental suffering
For one without expectations, village chief.
All fears are left behind
By one whose fetters are ended.

When attachment to life is ended,
In this very life as it is,
There is no fear of death,
It is just like laying down a burden.

I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
And developed the path well, too;
I have no fear of death
It is just like the ending of sickness.

I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
And developed the path well, too;
I’ve seen lives seen to be ungratifying,
Like one who has drunk poison, then vomited it out.

One who has gone beyond, without grasping,
Their duty completed, without defilements:
They are content at the end of life,
Just as one freed from execution.

Having realised the supreme Dhamma,
Without needing anything from the whole world,
One doesn’t grieve at death;
It is just like escaping from a burning house.

Whatever has come to pass,
Wherever life is obtained,
There is no-one who can wield power over all that:
So it was said by the great sage.

Whoever understands this
As it was taught by the Buddha
Doesn’t take hold of any kind of life,
It is just like grabbing a hot iron ball.

It doesn’t occur to me, ‘I had past lives’;
Nor does it occur to me, ‘I will have future lives’.
All conditions will disappear—
Why lament for that?

Seeing in accordance with reality
The bare arising of phenomena,
And the bare continuity of conditions,
There is no fear, village chief.

The world is like grass and wood:
When this is seen with understanding,
Not finding anything to be mine,
Thinking ‘it isn’t mine’, one doesn’t grieve.

I’m fed up with the body;
I don’t need another life.
This body will be broken up,
There won’t be another.

Do what you want
With my corpse.
I won’t be angry or attached
On that account.”

When they heard these words,
So astonishing that they gave them goose-bumps,
The young men laid down their swords
And said this:

“What have you practiced, Venerable?
Or who is your teacher?
Whose instructions do we follow
To gain the sorrowless state?”

“All-knowing, all-seeing,
The conqueror is my teacher.
He is a teacher of great compassion,
Healer of the whole world.

He taught this Dhamma,
Which leads to the end, unsurpassed.
Following his instructions,
You can gain the sorrowless state.”

When the bandits heard the good words of the sage,
They laid down their swords and weapons.
Some refrained from their deeds,
While others chose the going-forth.

When they had gone forth
In the teaching of the Fortunate One,
They developed the factors of awakening
And the spiritual powers,
And being wise, with joyful hearts, happy,
Their spiritual faculties complete,
They realised the state of nibbāna, the unconditioned.

## 16.2 Pārāpariya
While he was sitting alone
In seclusion, practicing jhāna,
An ascetic, the monk Pārāpariya
Had this thought:

“Following what system
What vow, what conduct,
May I do what I need to do for myself,
Without harming anyone else?

The faculties of human beings
Can lead to both welfare and harm.
Unguarded they lead to harm;
Guarded they lead to welfare.

By protecting the faculties,
Taking care of the faculties,
I can do what I need to do for myself
Without harming anyone else.

If your eye wanders
Among sights without check,
Not seeing the danger,
You’re not freed from suffering.

If your ear wanders
Among sounds without check,
Not seeing the danger,
You’re not freed from suffering.

If, not seeing the escape,
You indulge in smell,
You’re not freed from suffering,
Being infatuated by smells.

Recollecting the sour,
And the sweet and the bitter,
Captivated by craving for taste,
You don’t understand the heart.

Recollecting lovely
And pleasurable touches,
Full of desire, you experience
Many kinds of suffering because of lust.

Unable to protect
The mind from such mental phenomena,
Suffering follows them,
Because of all five.

This body is full of pus and blood,
As well as many carcasses;
But cunning people decorate it
Like a lovely painted casket.

You don’t understand that
The gratification of sweetness turns out bitter,
And attachments to those we love are suffering,
Like a razor smeared all over with honey.

Full of lust for the sight of a woman,
For the voice and the smells of a woman,
For a woman’s touch,
You experience many kinds of suffering.

All of a woman’s streams
Flow from five to five.
Whoever, being energetic,
Is able to curb these,

Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,
Would be clever and discerning;
Even while enjoying himself,
What he does is connected
With Dhamma and its purpose.

You should avoid a meaningless task
That is leading to decline.
Thinking, ‘This is not to be done’,
Is being diligent and discerning.

Whatever is meaningful,
A principled happiness,
Let one undertake and practice that:
This is the best happiness.

Coveting the possessions of others
By whatever means, whether high or low,
One kills, injures, and torments,
Violently plundering the possessions of others.

Just as a strong person when building
Knocks out a peg with a peg,
So the skilful person
Knocks out the faculties with the faculties.

Developing faith, energy, samādhi
Mindfulness, and wisdom;
Destroying the five with the five,
The perfected one lives without worry.

Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,
Having fulfilled in every respect
The instructions spoken by the Buddha,
That person prospers in happiness.”

## 16.3 Telakāni
For a long time, unfortunately,
Though I ardently contemplated the Dhamma,
I didn’t have peace of mind;
So I asked ascetics and holy men:

“Who has crossed over the world?
Whose attainment culminates in the deathless?
Whose teaching do I accept,
To understand the highest goal?

I was hooked inside,
Like a fish swallowing bait;
Bound like the demon Vepaciti
In Mahinda’s trap.

Dragging it along, I’m not freed
From grief and lamentation.
Who will free me from bonds in the world,
So that I may know awakening?

What ascetic or holy man
Points to the perishable?
Whose teaching do I accept
To wash away old age and death?

Tied up with uncertainty and doubt,
Secured by the power of pride,
Rigid as a mind overcome by anger;
The arrow of covetousness,

Propelled by the bow of craving,
Is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribs—
See how it stands in my breast,
Breaking my strong heart.

Speculative views are not abandoned,
They are sharpened by memories and intentions;
And pierced by this I tremble,
Like a leaf blown by wind.

Arising inside me,
My selfishness is quickly tormented,
Where the body always goes
With its six sense-fields of contact.

I don’t see a healer
Who could pull out my dart of doubt,
Without a lance
Or some other blade.

Without knife or wound,
Who will pull out this dart,
That is stuck inside me,
Without harming any part of my body?

He really would be the Lord of the Dhamma,
The best one to cure the damage of poison;
When I had fallen into deep waters,
He would give me his hand and bring me to the shore.

I’ve plunged into a lake,
And I can’t wash off the mud and dirt,
It’s full of fraud, jealousy, pride,
And dullness and drowsiness.

Like a thunder-cloud of restlessness,
Like a rain-cloud of fetters;
Intentions based on lust are winds
That sweep along a person with bad views.

The streams flow everywhere;
A weed springs up and remains;
Who will block the streams?
Who will cut the weed?”

“Venerable sir, build a dam
To block the streams;
Don’t let your mind-made streams
Cut you down suddenly like a tree.”

That is how the teacher whose weapon is wisdom,
The sage surrounded by the Saṅgha,
Was my shelter when I was full of fear,
Seeking the far shore from the near.

As I was being swept away,
He gave me a strong, simple ladder,
Made of the heartwood of Dhamma,
And he said to me: “Do not fear.”

I climbed the tower
Of the establishment of mindfulness
And looked back down,
At people delighting in identity,
Which in the past I’d obsessed over.

When I saw the path,
As I was embarking on the ship,
Without fixating on the self,
I saw the supreme landing-place.

The dart that arises in oneself,
And that which is caused
By attachment to future lives;
He taught the supreme path
For the stopping of these.

For a long time it had lain within me;
For a long time it was fixed in me:
The Buddha cast off the knot,
Curing the poison’s damage.

## 16.4 Raṭṭhapāla

See this fancy puppet,
A heap of sores, a composite body,
Diseased, obsessed over,
Having no lasting stability.

See this fancy shape,
With its gems and earrings;
It is bones wrapped with skin,
Made pretty by its clothes.

Rouged feet
And powdered face
Is enough to delude a fool,
But not a seeker of the far shore.

Hair in eight braids
And eyeliner,
Is enough to delude a fool,
But not a seeker of the far shore.

Like a newly decorated makeup box,
The disgusting body all adorned
Is enough to delude a fool,
But not a seeker of the far shore.

The hunter laid his trap,
But the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;
Having eaten the bait we go,
Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.

The hunter’s trap is broken,
And the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;
Having eaten the bait we go,
Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.

I see rich people in the world,
Who, because of delusion,
Don’t give away the wealth they have gained.
Greedily, they hoard their riches,
Yearning for ever more sensual pleasures.

A king who conquered the earth by force,
Ruling the land from sea to sea,
Unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,
Would still yearn for the further shore.

The king and most other people
Reach death while not free from craving.
As if lacking, they abandon the body;
For sensual pleasures offer
No satisfaction in this world.

Relatives lament, their hair let loose,
Saying “Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!”
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,
Heap up a pyre, and burn it.

It is poked with stakes while being burnt,
Wearing a single cloth, all wealth abandoned.
Neither kinsman nor friends nor companions
Can help you when you are dying.

Heirs take the riches,
But beings fare on in accord with their deeds.
Riches don’t follow you when you die;
Nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.

Longevity isn’t gained by riches,
Nor does wealth banish old age;
For the wise have said that this life is short,
It is not eternal, its nature is decay.

The rich and the poor feel its touch;
The fool and the wise feel it too;
But the fool lies as if struck down by their own folly,
While the wise don’t tremble at the touch.

Therefore wisdom is definitely better than wealth,
Since by wisdom
You can attain perfection in this life;
But if you stay unperfected,
Then because of delusion,
You’ll do evil deeds in life after life.

One person enters a womb and the world beyond,
Transmigrating from one life to the next;
While someone of little wisdom, placing faith in them,
Also enters a womb and the world beyond.

Just as a bandit caught at the entrance to a house
Is punished due to their own bad deeds;
So after passing away, in the world beyond
People are punished due to their own bad deeds.

Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful,
But their variety of forms stress the mind;
Seeing danger in the kinds of sensual pleasure,
I went forth, O King.

As fruit falls from a tree, so people fall,
Young and old, when the body breaks up.
Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;
Without doubt, the ascetic life is better.

Endowed with faith, I went forth,
Entering the conqueror’s teaching.
My going forth wasn’t wasted;
I eat food free of debt.

I saw sensual pleasures as burning,
Gold as a cutting blade,
Conception in a womb as suffering,
And the hells as very fearful.

Knowing this danger,
I was struck with awe.
I was stabbed, and then I became peaceful;
I’ve attained the end of defilements.

I’ve attended on the teacher
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
The heavy burden is laid down,
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn
In any state of existence.

I’ve attained the goal
For the sake of which I went forth
From home life into homelessness—
The ending of all fetters.

## 16.6 Sela
“Your body is perfect, you are radiant,
Handsome, lovely to behold,
Blessed One, you are golden coloured,
Your teeth are pure white, you are full of energy.
The characteristics
Of a handsome man,
The marks of a great man,
Are all in your body.
Your eyes are clear, your face is nice,
You are large, upright, and majestic.


In the middle of the Saṅgha of ascetics,
You shine like the sun.
You’re a good-looking monk,
With skin like gold;
With such excellent appearance,
What do you want with the ascetic life?
You’re worthy of being a king,
A wheel-rolling emperor, a bull among heroes,
Victorious in the four directions,
Lord of all India.
Warriors, lords, and kings
Are your followers
You are king above kings and lord of men—
Claim your kingship, Gotama!”
“Sela, I am a king,
Said the Blessed One to Sela,
“The unsurpassed king of Dhamma.
By Dhamma I set the wheel rolling,
The wheel which cannot be rolled back.”
“You claim to be awakened,”
Said Sela the brahman,
“The unsurpassed king of Dhamma.
‘By Dhamma I set the wheel rolling,’
That is what you say, Gotama.
Who is the Blessed One’s general,
The disciple who follows the teacher?

Who keeps on rolling
The wheel of Dhama you rolled forth?”
“I rolled forth the wheel,”
Said the Blessed One to Sela,
“The unexcelled wheel of Dhamma.
Sāriputta, who follows the Tathāgata’s example,
Keeps it rolling on.
What’s to be known is known;
What’s to be developed is developed;
I’ve abandoned what’s to be abandoned;
Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.
Dispel your doubt in me;
Make up your mind, brahman!
It’s always hard to gain
The sight of Buddhas.
I am one of those whose appearance
Is always hard to find in this world;
I am a Buddha, brahman,
The unexcelled remover of darts.
Holy, unequalled,
Crusher of Māra’s army;
Having subdued all enemies,
I rejoice, fearing nothing in any direction.”
“Listen, sirs, to what,
Is spoken by the seer.


Remover of darts, great hero,
Roaring like a lion in the jungle.
Holy, unequalled,
Crusher of Māra’s army;
Who could see him and not have faith,
Even one whose nature is dark?
Those who wish may follow me;
Those who don’t wish may go.
Right here, I’ll go forth,
In the presence of the glorious wise one.”
“If, sir, you adopt
The teaching of the Buddha,
We will also go forth
In the presence of the glorious wise one.”
These three hundred brahmans
With hands held in añjalī, ask:
“May we live the holy life
In your presence, Blessed One?”
“The holy life is well proclaimed,”
Said the Buddha to Sela,
“Apparent in this very life, without delay,
In which the going forth isn’t in vain,
For one heedful in the training.”
“It’s the eighth day, o seer,
Since we went to you for refuge.

In seven days, Blessed One,
We were tamed in your teaching.
You are the Buddha, you are the teacher
You are the sage who has overcome Māra;
You have cut off the underlying tendencies,
And having crossed over yourself,
You bring people across.
You have transcended attachments,
Your defilements have been torn apart;
Without grasping, like a lion,
You’ve abandoned fear and dread.
These three hundred monks
Stand with hands in añjalī:
Put out your feet, great hero,
Let these beings of power venerate the teacher.”
## 16.7 Kāḷigodhāputtabhaddiya
I rode on an elephant’s neck,
Wearing delicate clothes.
I ate rice conjey
With pure meat sauce.

Giving up a valuable bronze bowl,
And a precious golden one, too,
I took up a clay bowl:
This is my second initiation.
Formerly I lived in a citadel
Surrounded by high walls,

With strong battlements and gates,
And guarded by swordsmen—
And I trembled with fear.
Today I am fortunate, free of trembling,
With fear and dread abandoned.
Bhaddiya, son of Godhā,
Has plunged into the forest and practices jhāna.
Established in all the practices of virtue,
Developing mindfulness and understanding,
Gradually I attained
The end of all fetters.
## 16.8 Aṅgulimāla
“Ascetic, you’re walking,
But you say ‘I’m standing still’;
And I’m standing still, but you tell me I’m not.
I’m asking you this, ascetic:
Why are you standing still and I’m not?”
“Aṅgulimāla, I always stand still—
I’ve given up violence towards all living beings.
But you have no restraint towards living creatures;
That’s why I’m standing still and you’re not.”
“It’s a been a long time since an ascetic,
A great sage who I honour,
Has entered this great forest.
Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,
I’ll discard a thousand evils.”


With these words,
The bandit hurled his sword and weapons
Down a pit, a cliff, a chasm.
Right there, he venerated the Fortunate One’s feet,
And asked the Buddha for the going-forth.
Then the Buddha, the compassionate great sage,
The teacher of the world together with its gods,
Said to him, “Come, monk!”
Just this was enough for him to be a monk.
“Whoever was heedless before,
And afterwards is not,
Lights up the world,
Like the moon freed from a cloud.
One whose bad deed
Is blocked by skilful action,
Lights up the world,
Like the moon freed from a cloud.
The young monk
Who is devoted to the teaching of the Buddha,
Lights up the world,
Like the moon freed from a cloud.
May even my enemies hear a Dhamma talk!
May even my enemies
Devote themselves to Buddha’s teaching!
May even my enemies associate when they can,
With those who establish people in the Dhamma!

May even my enemies hear Dhamma at suitable times,
From those who speak on acceptance,
Praising acquiescence;
And may they practice accordingly!
They would definitely not harm
Me or anyone else;
But would attain the ultimate peace,
Looking after creatures both firm and fragile.
Irrigators lead water,
Fletchers shape arrows,
Carpenters shape wood;
The disciplined tame themselves.
Some tame with sticks,
With hooked poles or whips;
But the poised one tamed me
Without rod or sword.
My name is ‘Harmless’,
Though I used to be harmful.
Today my name is truthful,
As I don’t harm anyone.
I used to be a bandit,
The notorious Aṅgulimāla.
Swept away in a great flood,
I went to Buddha as a refuge.
I used to have blood on my hands,
The notorious Aṅgulimāla.


See my going for refuge—
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn
In any state of existence.
I’ve done many such deeds
As lead to a bad destination.
I’ve experienced the result of my deeds,
So I enjoy my food free of debt.
Fools and unintelligent people
Devote themselves to heedlessness.
But the intelligent protect heedfulness
As their best treasure.
Don’t devote yourself to heedlessness,
Nor delight in sexual intimacy.
If you are heedful and practice jhāna
You’ll attain the highest happiness.
It was welcome, not unwelcome,
The advice I got was good.
Of things which are shared,
I encountered the best.
It was welcome, not unwelcome,
The advice I got was good.
I’ve attained the three knowledges,
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
In the wilderness, at the foot of a tree,
In mountains, or in caves;

At that time, wherever I stood,
My mind was anxious.
But now I lie down happily and stand up happily,
I live my life happily,
Out of Māra’s reach;
The teacher had compassion for me.
I used to belong to the brahman caste,
Highborn on both sides,
Now I’m a son of the Fortunate One,
The teacher, the King of Dhamma.
I am free of craving, without grasping,
My sense-doors are guarded and well-restrained.
I’ve destroyed the root of misery,
And attained the end of defilements.
I’ve attended on the teacher
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
The heavy burden is laid down,
I’ve undone the attachment
To being reborn in any state of existence.”
## 16.9 Anuruddha
Leaving my mother and father behind,
As well as sisters, kinsmen, and brothers;
Abandoning the five kinds of sensual pleasures,
Anuruddha practices jhāna.
Surrounded by song and dance,
Awakened by cymbals and gongs,


He did not find purification,
While delighting in Māra’s domain.
But he has gone beyond all that,
And delights in the teaching of the Buddha.
Having crossed over the entire flood,
Anuruddha practices jhāna.
Sights, sounds, tastes, smells;
Touches that please the mind.
Having crossed over these as well,
Anuruddha practices jhāna.
The sage returned from alms-round,
Alone, without companion.
Seeking rags from the dust heap,
Anuruddha is without defilements.
The thoughtful sage
Selected rags from the dust heap;
He picked them up, washed, dyed, and wore them;
Anuruddha is without defilements.
The principles of someone
Who has many wishes and is not content,
Who socializes and is conceited,
Are wicked and corrupted.
But someone who is mindful, of few wishes,
Content and untroubled,
Delighting in seclusion, joyful,
Always resolute and energetic;

Their principles are skilful,
Leading to awakening;
They are without defilements—
So it was said by the great sage.
Knowing my thought,
The world’s unsurpassed teacher
Came up to me in his mind-made body,
Using his psychic powers.
When I had that thought
He taught me more.
The Buddha,
Delighting in freedom from proliferation,
Taught it to me.
Understanding the Dhamma,
I lived happily in the teaching.
I’ve attained the three knowledges,
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
For the last fifty-five years
I have not lain down to sleep;
Twenty-five years have passed
Since drowsiness was uprooted.
The poised one, with steady heart,
Was not breathing;
Imperturbable, committed to peace,
The seer has realised nibbāna.


With a positive mind
He put up with painful feelings;
The liberation of his heart
Was like the quenching of a lamp.
Now these touches and the other four
Are the last to be experienced by the sage;
Nor will there be other mental phenomena
Since the Buddha realised nibbāna.
Weaver of the web, now there are no future lives
In the company of gods.
Transmigration through births is finished,
Now there is no more rebirth
Into any state of existence.
Whoever in a moment knows the thousand-fold world,
Together with the Brahmā realm;
That monk, a master of psychic powers,
Knowing the passing away and rebirth of beings,
Sees even the gods at that time.
In the past I was Annabhāra,
A poor carrier of fodder.
I made an offering
To the renowned ascetic, Upariṭṭha.
Then I was born in the Sakyan clan,
Where I was known as “Anuruddha”.
Surrounded by song and dance,
I was awakened by cymbals and gongs.

Then I saw the Buddha
The teacher, without fear from any direction;
Filling my mind with confidence in him,
I went forth into homelessness.
I know my past life,
Where I used to live—
I was born as Sakka,
And stayed among the Tāvatiṃsa gods.
Seven times I was a king of men
Ruling a kingdom,
Victorious in the four directions,
Lord of all India.
Without violence or sword,
I governed by principle.
Seven here, seven there,
For fourteen transmigrations
I remember my past lives;
At that time I stayed in the realm of the gods.
I have gained complete tranquillity
In samādhi with five factors;
Peaceful, serene,
My clairvoyance is purified.
Steady in jhāna with five factors,
I know the passing away and rebirth of beings,
Their coming and going,
Their lives in this state and that.


I’ve attended on the teacher
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
The heavy burden is laid down,
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn
In any state of existence.
In the Vajjian village of Veḷuva,
At the end of life,
Beneath a thicket of bamboos,
I’ll realise nibbāna without defilements.
## 16.10 Pārāpariya
While the ascetic practiced jhāna,
Seated in seclusion, unified,
In the forest full of flowers,
This thought came to him:
“The behaviour of the monks
These days seems different
From when the lord of the world,
The best of men, was still here.
Their robes were only for covering the private parts,
And protection from the cold and wind;
They ate in moderation,
Content with whatever they were offered.
Whether refined or rough,
Little or much,
They ate only for sustenance,
Without greed or gluttony.

They weren’t so very eager,
For the requisites of life,
Such as tonics and other necessities,
As they were for the end of defilements.
In the wilderness, at the foot of trees,
In caves and caverns,
Committed to seclusion,
They lived with that as their final goal.
They were used to simple things,
And were easy to look after,
Gentle, their hearts not stubborn,
Unsullied, not talkative,
Their minds were intent on the goal.
In this way they inspired confidence,
In their movements, eating, and practice;
Their deportment was smooth
As a stream of oil.
With the ending of all defilements,
Those senior monks have now realised nibbāna;
They were great meditators and great benefactors—
There are few like them today.
With the ending
Of good principles and understanding,
The conqueror’s teaching,
Full of all excellent qualities, has fallen apart.


This is the season
For bad principles and defilements.
Those who are ready for seclusion
Are all that’s left of the true Dhamma.
As they grow, the defilements
Possess many people;
They play with fools, I believe,
Like demons with the mad.
Overcome by defilements,
They run here and there
Among the causes for defilement,
As if they had declared war on themselves.
Having abandoned true Dhamma,
They argue with each other;
Following wrong views
They think, ‘This is better.’
They cut off their wealth,
Children, and wife to go forth;
But then they do what they shouldn’t,
For the sake of a measly spoon of alms-food.
They eat until their bellies are full,
And then they lie to sleep on their backs.
When they wake again, they keep on talking,
The kind of talk that the teacher criticized.
Valuing all the arts and crafts,
They train themselves in them;

Not being calm inside,
They think, ‘This is the purpose of the ascetic life’.
They provide clay, oil, and talcum powder,
Water, lodgings, and food
For householders,
Expecting more in return.
As well as tooth-picks, wood-apples,
Flowers, food to eat,
Well-cooked alms-food,
Mangoes and myrobalans.
In medicine they are like doctors,
In business like householders,
In decoration like prostitutes,
In sovereignty like lords.
Cheats, frauds,
False witnesses, sly:
Using multiple plans,
They enjoy material things.
Pursuing shams, contrivances, and plans,
By this means
They accumulate a lot of wealth
For the sake of their livelihood.
They assemble the community
For business rather than Dhamma.
They teach the Dhamma to others
For gain, not for the goal.


Those outside the Saṅgha
Quarrel over the Saṅgha’s property.
They’re shameless, and do not care
That they live on someone else’s property.
Some who have a shaven head
And wear the outer robe,
Are not devoted to practice,
But wish only to be honored,
Infatuated with property and reverence.
When things have come to this,
It’s not easy these days
To realise what has not yet been realised,
Or to preserve what has been realised.
A person with mindfulness established
Could walk without shoes
Even in a thorny place;
That is how a sage should walk in the village.
Remembering the meditators of old,
And recollecting their conduct;
Even in the latter days,
It is still possible to realise the deathless.”
That is what the ascetic, whose faculties
Were fully developed, said in the sāla tree grove.
The holy man, the sage, realised nibbāna:
Ending more rebirth into any state of existence.
