Mindfulness becomes confused,
If attention is focussed on the pleasant aspect.
Experiencing it with a mind full of desire,
One remains clinging to it.

Many feelings grow
Arising from sights.
The mind is damaged
By covetousness and cruelty.
Heaping up suffering like this,
Is said to be far from nibbāna.
