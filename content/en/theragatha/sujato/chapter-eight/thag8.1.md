# 8.1 Mahākaccāyana  

Don’t get involved in lots of work,  
Avoid people, and don’t try to get more requisites.  
If you’re eager and greedy for flavours,  
You’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.  

They know that this really is a bog,  
This homage and veneration  
Among respectable families.  
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,  
And hard for a bad man to give up.  

Your deeds aren’t bad  
Because of what others do.  
You yourself should not do bad,  
For people have deeds as their kin.  

You’re not a criminal  
Because of what someone else says,  
And you’re not a sage  
Because of what someone else says;  
But as you know yourself,  
So the gods will know you.  

Others don’t understand,  
That here we come to an end.  
Those who do understand this  
Settle their quarrels.  

A wise person lives on,  
Even after their wealth is lost;  
But without gaining wisdom,  
Even a wealthy person doesn’t really live.  

All is heard with the ear,  
All is seen with the eye;  
The wise would not think that all  
That is seen and heard  
Is worthy of rejection.  

Though you have eyes, be as if blind;  
Though you have ears, be as if deaf,  
Though you have wisdom, be as if stupid,  
Though you have strength, be as if feeble.  
Then, when the goal has been realised,  
You may lie on your death-bed.
