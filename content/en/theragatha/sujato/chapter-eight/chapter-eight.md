# Chapter Eight

## [8.1 Mahākaccāyana](../thag8.1/)

Don’t get involved in lots of work,  
Avoid people, and don’t try to get more requisites.  
If you’re eager and greedy for flavours,  
You’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness.  

They know that this really is a bog,  
This homage and veneration  
Among respectable families.  
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,  
And hard for a bad man to give up.  

Your deeds aren’t bad  
Because of what others do.  
You yourself should not do bad,  
For people have deeds as their kin.  

You’re not a criminal  
Because of what someone else says,  
And you’re not a sage  
Because of what someone else says;  
But as you know yourself,  
So the gods will know you.  

Others don’t understand,  
That here we come to an end.  
Those who do understand this  
Settle their quarrels.  

A wise person lives on,  
Even after their wealth is lost;  
But without gaining wisdom,  
Even a wealthy person doesn’t really live.  

All is heard with the ear,  
All is seen with the eye;  
The wise would not think that all  
That is seen and heard  
Is worthy of rejection.  

Though you have eyes, be as if blind;  
Though you have ears, be as if deaf,  
Though you have wisdom, be as if stupid,  
Though you have strength, be as if feeble.  
Then, when the goal has been realised,  
You may lie on your death-bed.

## [8.2 Sirimitta](../thag8.2/)

Without anger or resentment,  
Without deceit, and rid of slander,  
Such a monk, poised,  
Doesn’t sorrow after death.  

Without anger or resentment,  
Without deceit, and rid of slander,  
A monk with sense doors guarded,  
Doesn’t sorrow after death.  

Without anger or resentment,  
Without deceit, and rid of slander,  
A monk of good virtue  
Doesn’t sorrow after death.  

Without anger or resentment,  
Without deceit, and rid of slander,  
A monk with good friends  
Doesn’t sorrow after death.  

Without anger or resentment,  
Without deceit, and rid of slander,  
A monk of good wisdom,  
Doesn’t sorrow after death.  

Whoever has faith in the Tathāgata,  
That is unshakable and firmly established,  
Whose ethics are good,  
Pleasing to the noble ones, and praiseworthy,  

Who has confidence in the Saṅgha,  
And whose vision is straight—  
They’re called “free from poverty”;  
Their life is not wasted.  

Therefore a wise person would devote themselves  
To faith, virtue,  
Confidence, and the vision of Dhamma,  
Remembering the teaching of the Buddhas.

## [8.3 Mahāpanthaka](../thag8.3/)

When I first saw the teacher,  
Who was free of fear from any direction,  
I was struck with awe,  
Since I’d seen the best of men.  

If you have the good luck  
To find such a teacher,  
But you push it all away,  
You’ll lose your chance.  

Then I left behind my children and wife,  
My riches and my grain;  
I cut off my hair and beard,  
And went forth into homelessness.  

Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood,  
My sense faculties well-restrained,  
Paying homage to the Buddha,  
I dwelt undefeated.  

Then a resolve occurred to me,  
My heart’s truest wish:  
I wouldn’t sit down, not even for a moment,  
Until the dart of craving was pulled out.  

As I dwell like this,  
See my energy and striving!  
I’ve attained the three knowledges,  
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.  

I know my past life;  
My clairvoyance is clarified;  
I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,  
Liberated, without attachments.  

Then, at the end of the night,  
As the rising of the sun drew near,  
All craving was dried up,  
So I sat down cross-legged.
