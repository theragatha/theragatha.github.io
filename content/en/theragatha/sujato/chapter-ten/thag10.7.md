# 10.7 (Apara) Gotama  

You should understand your own purpose,  
And consider the teachings carefully,  
As well as what’s appropriate,  
For one who has entered the ascetic life.  

Good friendship in the community,  
Undertaking lots of training,  
Listening well to the teacher—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Respect for the Buddha,  
Reverence for the Dhamma as it really is,  
Esteem for the Saṅgha—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Devotion to good conduct and resort,  
A livelihood that is pure and blameless,  
And settling the mind—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

A pleasing manner in things that should be done,  
And those that should be avoided;  
Devotion to the higher mind—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Wilderness lodgings  
Remote, with little noise,  
Fit for use by a sage—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Ethics, learning,  
Investigation of Dhamma as it really is,  
And penetration of the truths—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Developing the perceptions  
Of impermanence, non-self, and unattractiveness,  
And displeasure with the whole world—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

Developing the factors of awakening,  
The bases for psychic power,  
The spiritual faculties and powers,  
And the noble eight-fold path—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.  

A sage should abandon craving,  
With defilements split apart, root and all,  
They should live liberated—  
This is appropriate for an ascetic.
