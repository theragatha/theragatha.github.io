## 1.62 Vajji-putta

Each by himself we in the forest dwell,\
Like logs rejected by the woodman's craft.\
So flit the days one like another by,\
Who more unlucky in their lot than we?

 Each by himself we in the forest dwell,\
Like logs rejected by the woodman's craft.\
And many a one doth envy me my lot,\
E'en as the hell-bound him who fares to heaven.
