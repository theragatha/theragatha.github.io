# 1.44 Sānu

Do nought of evil, open or concealed,\
If evil thou now doest or wilt do,\
Thou'lt not escape from ill, e'en though thou flee.

 Mother, they weep for the dead, or the living they may not see.\
But for him, O mother, who lives, who is here, why mournest thou me?

They mourn for son who lieth dead, or him\
Who is alive but whom they no more see.\
And him they mourn, who though he did renounce\
The world, my son, doth hither come again,\
For though he live again, yet is he dead.\
Drawn forth from burning embers, O my dear,\
Dost thou on embers wish to fall again?
