# 1.43 Sumaṅgala

Well rid, well rid, O excellently rid\
Am I from these three crooked tasks and tools,\
Rid o' my reaping with your sickles, rid\
Of trudging after ploughs, and rid's my back\
Of bending o'er these wretched little spades.\
 Though they be ever here, ay, ever here,\
Enough of them, I say, for me, enough!\
Go meditate, Sumaṅgala, ay, go\
And meditate, Sumaṅgala, and bide\
Earnest and diligent, Sumaṅgala!
