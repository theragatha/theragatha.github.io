# Uttiya

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu in the family of a Sakiyan rāja, he was named Uttiya. [^1] Come to years of discretion, he witnessed the power of the Buddha when the latter came to visit his kin, [^2] believed in him, and entered the Order. As a student he visited the village one day for alms, and on the way he heard a woman singing, and his concentration gave way, desire and passion arising in him. Checking himself by the power of reflection, he [93] entered the Vihāra much agitated, and seating himself for siesta-meditation, he so developed insight that he won arahantship. Thereupon he mentioned his release from the ills of rebirth, through disgust at the corruptions, in this verse:

## Verses

[99] Sound of sweet voice bewildering self-control,\
If one but think upon the image dear,\
The heart inflamed in feeling doth o'erflow\
And clinging stayeth. Thus in him do grow\
The deadly taints that bring Saṇsāra[^3] near.
