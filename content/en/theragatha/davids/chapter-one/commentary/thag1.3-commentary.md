# Kankhā-Revata

## Commentary

He was reborn in the days of our Exalted One in a wealthy family of Sāvatthī. And as he stood in the outermost ring of those who went after dinner to hear Him-of-the-Ten-Powers preach, he believed, and thereupon entered the Order. And he attained arahantship by way of practising jhāna; and so proficient in jhāna did he become, that the Master pronounced him chief of the bhikkhus who practised it.

[^1] [8] His task accomplished thus, this great Brother reflected on the inveterate tendency of his mind to doubt, [^2] now wholly overcome, and praised the might and wisdom of the Exalted One, whereby his mind was now calm and steadfast, saying:

## Verses

[3] Behold how great the wisdom is of Them\
Who Thus-have-come![^3] As fire at midnight hour,\
Givers of light, givers of sight are they\
To those that pass, subduing all their doubt.

## Attribution

Thus verily did the venerable Brother Kankhā-Revata utter his psalm.

## Notes

[^1]: Ang. Nik., i. 24.

[^2]: This tendency is mentioned in the Apadāna. The soubriquet it earned may have been maintained undeservedly to distinguish Revātā from the more distinguished Mahā-Thera Revata, co-Director of the Council of Vesālī ( Vinaya Texts, ii. 317; cf. 67).

[^3]: Tathāigatā. For a full exposition of this famous term, the Comy, refers to the Udāna and Iti-Vuttaka Commentaries Cf. J. H. Moore, Sayings of Buddha, p. 131; Sir R. Chalmers, JRAS, 1898, 108.
