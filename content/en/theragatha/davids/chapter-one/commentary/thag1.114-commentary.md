# Adhimutta

## Commentary

 

Reborn in this Buddha-age in a brahmin family at Sāvatthī and named Adhimutta, he became discontented at finding no pith in the brahmin wisdom, and while he was seeking to escape during his last span of life, he saw the majesty of the Buddha at the presentation of the Jeta Grove. Entering the Order, he in due course won arahantship. Thereupon he admonished those bhikkhus dwelling with him who were very corpulent, in this verse:

## Verses

[114] If ye to this gross body give such heed,\
Greedy its pleasures to enjoy, the while\
Life's energies do ebb away, O whence\
Shall come perfection in the holy life?
