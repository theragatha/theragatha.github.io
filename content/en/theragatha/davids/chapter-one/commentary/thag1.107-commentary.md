# Dhammāsava

## Commentary

Reborn in the kingdom of Magadha in a brahmin's family, and impelled by maturity of conditions, he preferred the religious to the household life. Seeking the Exalted One on the South Hill, [^1] he heard him teach the Norm, whereupon he entered the Order, and in due course became an arahant. And reflecting with joy upon his career, he broke forth in this psalm, confessing aññā:

## Verses

[107] I pondered well, then sought the life that lay\
Beyond the walls and bonds of household life.\
The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,\
And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.[^2]
