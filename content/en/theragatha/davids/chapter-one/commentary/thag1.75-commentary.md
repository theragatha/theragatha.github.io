# Susārada

## Commentary

He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāriputta's native place, [^1] in a brahmin's family, and was called Susārada [75] (Dullard), because he was slow in growing. [^2] He was converted by the teaching of that Thera and in due time, as a bhikkhu, became an arahant, and confessed his aññā in this verse:

## Verses

[75] O goodly is the sight of cultured minds![^3]\
Doubt is cut off, and wisdom grows apace.\
E'en of a fool they make an able man;\
Hence goodly is the intercourse with saints.

## Notes

[^1]: Nālaka-village in Magadha.

[^2]: Susārada means 'very autumnal' - i.e., as it were, 'having undeveloped seed or growth,' and corresponding therefore to early springtime in our climate. Cf. JPTS, 1909, p. 150; and the contrary, visārada, below, CCII, verse 338.

[^3]: It is a detail of interest that on the word suvihitāna, rendered bv 'cultured' (lit., well-disposed, ordered, or practised), the Commentary remarks anusvāralopo kato; the terminal ṁ has been cut off, gāthā-sukhatthaṁ, for prosodical reasons. With line 3, cf. Sisters, verse 213.
