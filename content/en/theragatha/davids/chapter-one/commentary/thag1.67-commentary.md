# Ekadhamma Savanīya

## Commentary

 

He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Setavyā,[^1] in the family of a councillor. When the Exalted One visited Setavyā, and stayed in the Singsapa Wood, he went to listen [68] to him, saluting, and sitting down at one side. The Master contemplated his inclinations, and taught him the Norm in the verse:

## Verses

Impermanent indeed are all component things[^2]

[67] Burnt up in me is all that doth defile,\
And rooted out all life's continuance;\
Slain utterly the cycle of re-birth:\
Now is there no more coming back to be.[^3]

## Notes

[^1]: In Kosala. Cf. Dialogues, ii. 349; Sutta Nipāita, verse 1012; Ang., ii. 37.

[^2]: See Dialogues, ii. 175: 'They're transient all,' etc.

[^3]: This phrase and that of 'life's continuance' are in the Pali both bhava, first plural, then singular with prefix of puna, 'again'; lit., 'becomings' and 'becoming-again.' By the plural form the three chief modes of rebirth are understood - kāma-, rūpa and arūpa-bhava - as well as both kammabhava, or that continuity of action or character which determines future bhava, and the uppatti-bhava, or resultant rebirth itself (so the Commentary). This doctrine is explained in the Compendium of Philosophy, especially pp. 262-264.
