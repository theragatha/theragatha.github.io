# Abhaya (2)

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī in a brahmin family, he was called Abhaya. After he had heard the Master teach and had entered the Order, he went one day for alms into the village [^1] and saw a woman attractively dressed. This disturbed his mental composure, so that he returned to the Vihāra thinking: 'Looking on a visible object has corrupted me. I have done amiss.' Thus repudiating that consciousness, he so developed insight as to win arahantship.

Thereupon he reviewed his moral slip and his recovery in this verse:

## Verses

[98] Sight of fair shape bewildering self-control,[^2]\
If one but heed the image sweet and dear,\
The heart inflamed in feeling doth o'erflow\
And clinging stayeth. Thus in him do grow\
The deadly taints[^3] that bring new living near.

## Notes

[^1]: So in XIX. and XXIX. This is clearly not the Abhaya of XXVI.

[^2]: Sati - mindfulness, heedfulness, control of thought.

[^3]: Āsavā. Cf. verses 794 ff.; Saṁy., iv. 78.
