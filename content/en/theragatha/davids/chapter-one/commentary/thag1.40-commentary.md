# Vaḍḍhamāna

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Vesalī, in the family of a Licchavi rāja, he became as a pious lad a servitor to the Order. Later, after he had been ordained, he also was subject to sloth and torpor, and was also aroused by the Master with this verse :

## Verses

[40] As one downsmitten by impending sword,\
As one whose hair and turban are aflame,\
So let the Brother, mindful and alert,\
Go forth, all lust of living[^1] left behind.
