# Sāmidatta

## Commentary

Puissance. OED: Power, strength, force, might, influence. — p.p.

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha as the son of a brahmin, he was called Sāmidatta. When arrived at years of discretion, he heard of the Buddha's puissance, and went with laymen to the Vihāra to hear him. He believed and entered the Order, but from the immaturity of his knowledge he continued for a little while without application. Finally, on again hearing the Master teach, he became devoted and intent, and won arahantship.

Later on the bhikkhus asked him: 'How now, friend, have you reached the state of the elect?' [^1] And he, showing the guiding efficacy of the doctrine, and his own attainment in the Norm and minor doctrines (dhammānudhamma), confessed aññā in this verse:

## Verses

[90] The factors of my life well understood\
Stand yet a little while with severed root.\
Slain is the round of living aye renewed.\
Now is there no more coming back to be.[^2]
