# Sañjaya

## Commentary

 

He was reborn in this Buddha-age, at Rājagaha, as the son of a wealthy brahmin. Grown up, he followed the example of Brahmāyu, Pokkharasāti and other well-known brahmins, who found faith in the Master and reached the First Path. Later he entered the Order and acquired the [53] six abhiññās. Then, confessing anna, he uttered this verse:

## Verses

[48] Since I went forth from home to homeless life,\
Ne'er have I harboured conscious wish or plan\
Un-Ariyan, or linked with enmity.[^1]

## Attribution



## Notes

[^1]: Cf. verses 603, 645. Pokkharasāti and other brahmins are named as adherents in the Vāseṭṭha Sutta ( Sutta-Nipāta, iii. 9), but Sañjāyā is not mentioned. This is not the teacher of Sāriputta (CCLIX.) .
