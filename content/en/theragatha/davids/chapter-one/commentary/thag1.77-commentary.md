# Hatthāroha-Putta

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, in the family of an elephant-driver, as he grew up, he became proficient in managing elephants. One day, as he was training an elephant by the river, he was impelled by maturing conditions to think: 'What is all this elephant-taming to me? Better is it to tame one's self.' So he went to the Exalted One, heard the Norm, believed, entered the Order, and exercised himself in insight on a basis of ethical meditation. And as a skilful elephant-trainer restrains savage ways by his hook, so he by meditation suffered not his thoughts to wander away from his exercise, saying this verse:

## Verses

[77] Once roamed this heart a field, a wanderer\
Wherever will, or whim, or pleasure led.\
To-day that heart I'll hold in thorough check,\
As trainer's hook the savage elephant.[^1]

## Attribution

And so acting, his insight expanded, and he realized arahantship.

## Notes

[^1]: This goes to form one verse in the interesting poem ascribed to Tālapuṭa (CCLXII, 1130). 'Trainer's hook,' more accurately 'grasper of the hook.'
