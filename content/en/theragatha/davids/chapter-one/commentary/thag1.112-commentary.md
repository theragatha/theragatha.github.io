# Vacchag

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha as the son of a wealthy brahmin, and because there were four Theras named Vaccha, he was called Vacchagotta. [^1] Come to years of discretion, and expert in brahmin learning, he, as a seeker after emancipation, found no pith in those studies, and became a wandering recluse. As such he met and questioned the Master. Satisfied with the answers, he entered the Order, and in due course acquired sixfold abhiññā. [^2] Reflecting with joy upon his career, he uttered this psalm:

## Verses

[112] The Threefold Lore is mine, and I excel\
In Jhāna-ecstasy, adept in calm\
Of balanced mind. Salvation have I won,\
And all the Buddha-ordinance is done.

## Notes

[^1]: The others were called, one, Pilinda-Vaccha (IX.) and two, Vana-Vaccha (XIV. and CXIII.).

[^2]: The two conversations occur in Majjh., i., 72nd and 73rd Suttas. Vacchagotta's ordination is also mentioned, and how the Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of Calm and Insight, whereby sixfold abhiññā might be acquired. Cf. Compendium, part ix.
