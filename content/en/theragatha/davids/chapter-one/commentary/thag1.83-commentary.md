# Sīha

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age in the country of the Mallas, in the family of a rāja, he was named Sīha (Leo). Seeing the Exalted One, he was attracted by him, saluted him and sat down at one side. The Master discerned the trend of his mind and taught him the Norm, so that he believed, entered the Order, and, taking his exercise, dwelt in the forest. His thoughts were distracted by many objects and he could not concentrate. [^1] The Master saw this and, standing over him, uttered this verse:

## Verses

[83] O Siha! persevere in earnestness;\
By night and day abide unfaltering.\
Engender the good Norm within thy heart.\
Swiftly renounce that piled up base of birth.[^2]

## Attribution

Hereby the Thera was able to expand insight and win arahantship. And, confessing aññā, he repeated the verse.

## Notes

[^1]: Lit., 'to him one-point-nees comes not'; the usual psychological term, to which we can only approximate in our 'concentration.' Cf. Compendium, pp. 237, 240 f.

[^2]: Samussayo, lit., 'accumulation.' Commentary = 'the passions binding to personal existence.' Used for the body, or whole living aggregate. Cf. Sisters, verse 22.
