# Vacchapāla

## Commentary

 

He was born in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha, as the son of a rich brahmin, and was named Vacchapāla (calf-herd). He saw when the Master met Bimbisāra, the selfsubmission of Uruvela-Kassapa to the Exalted One,[^1] and believing, entered the Order. In a week he had so developed insight as to have acquired sixfold abhiññā.

As arahant he extolled in sheer happiness his attainment of Nibbāna in this verse:

## Verses

Is there a man who can the truth discern\
Tho' it be very subtle and refined,\
Who, skilled to measure spiritual growth,\
Is yet of lowly and of gentle mind,\
Who shapes his life by rule of Them that Wake:[^2]\
For him Nibbāna is not hard to find.

## Attribution

And this was the Brother's confession of aññā.
