# Devasabha</a>

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age as the son of the rāja of a district, [^2] he succeeded to his title when quite young. But [84] when being awakened (buddho) he went to hear the Master teach, he resigned his title, entered the Order, and anon won arahantship. Then joy arose in him when he reflected on the corrupting things he had put away, and he burst forth in this psalm:

## Verses

[89] Transcended is the miry bog of lusts.\
Past doom infernal am I safely come\
From flood and fetter dire to liberty,\
And shed is every form of self conceit.[^3]

## Attribution



## Notes

[^1]: Ps. C. is by another Devasabha.

[^2]: Maṇḍdalika-rāja. This term occurs in Vinaya Texts, iii. 47. I have no evidence of the comparative rank attaching to the title.

[^3]: Māna. Nine forms are distinguished ( Vibh., p. 389). Cf. Bud. Psy., p. 299, which gives the first three only.
