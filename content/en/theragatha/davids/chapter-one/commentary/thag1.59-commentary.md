# Kosalavihārin

## Commentary

His story resembles that of the Añjana-Woodlander, with this difference: after his novitiate, he dwelt in the forest by a village in the kingdom of Kosala, near the dwelling of a lay adherent. The latter, seeing him camped under a [60] tree, made a little hut and gave it him. There the Thera attained arahantship. Then filled with rapture at his emancipation, he uttered this psalm:

## Verses

[59] Strong in my faith[^1] I left the world. Now here\
Within the woods a hut is made for me;\
And I with zeal and ardour meditate,\
With watchful wit and clarity of mind.

## Attribution

This was his confession of aññā, and because he dwelt so long in Kosala, he became known as the Kosala settler.

## Notes

[^1]: 'When I saw the might of the Exalted One at Vesālī, I thought: "Absolutely able to guide is this doctrine and ordinance; therefore shall I verily through this attainment be set free from old age and death." And because of the faith thus arisen, I went forth' (Commentary). The last two lines in the stanza are an expansion of four adjectives, the sentence lacking expressed subject and predicate.
