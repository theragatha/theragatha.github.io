# Kuṭivihārin</a>

## Commentary

His story (in this life) is like that of Añjana-vaniya, with this difference: while striving for insight he was walking by the fields, and took shelter from the rain in the little empty hut of the field-watchman, and there won arahantship. Thereupon the watchman came and said: 'Who is in the hut?' The answer was: 'A bhikkhu is in the hut,' and the rest of the verse:

## Verses

[56] Who's in my little hut? A brother 'tis,\
Who in thy little hut, all passions tamed,\
Hath throughly set his mind. Know this, O friend,\
'Twas not for naught thou mad'st thy little hut!

Within the hut a brother dwells, peace in his heart, purged of all taint.\
Fruit of this deed shall be to thee: lord of the gods thou'll come to be\
Six times, ay, seven, lord of the gods, ruler over celestial realms,\
Thereafter all thy passions tamed, a Silent Buddha[^2] thou shalt be.

## Attribution

From that time the Thera began to be called Kuṭivihārin.
