# Belaṭṭhasīsa

## Commentary

In this Buddha-age he was reborn at Sāvatthī in a brahmin's family, and before the Exalted One became a Buddha he left the world to join the ascetic Order of Kassapa of Uruvelā, and tend the sacred fire. And when Kassapa was tamed by the Buddha, [^1] he was one of the thousand ascetics who obtained arahantship on hearing the sermon on Burning. [^2]

He thereafter became the tutor of the 'Treasurer of the Norm.' [^3] And one day, reflecting on the pure bliss of fruition and his own earlier discipline, in rapture he uttered a psalm:

## Verses

[16] E'en as the high-bred steer[^4] with crested buck[^5]\
Lightly the plough adown the furrow turns,\
So lightly glide for me the nights and days\
Now that this pure untainted bliss is won.

## Notes

[^1]: See Vinaya Texts, i. 118-134.

[^2]: Ibid., p. 134 f.

[^3]: A soubriquet of the Elder Ānanda. Belaṭṭhasīsa is also mentioned as a sufferer from eczema ( Vin. Texts, ii. 48, 226), and as committing a minor offence in storing food ( Vin., iv. 86). The Commentarial tradition is that Dhammapada verse 92 refers to the last-named incident ( Dhp. Com., ii. 170).

[^4]: The text bhaddo ājañño, 'noble, or spirited thoroughbred,' is declared by the Commentary to imply, out of the three creatures to which this epithet is applied - bull, horse, elephant - the first named, as the only one used for ploughing.

[^5]: Sikhī, 'crested,' is applicable to either the horns or the hump of the zebu (Commentary).
