# Rāmaṇeyyaka

## Commentary

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī in a wealthy family, his heart was moved when the Jeta Grove was presented, [^1] and he left the world. Dwelling in the forest he meditated on ethical conduct, and, because of his attainments and charm, he became called Rāmaṇeyyaka (Gratus, Gratulus) .

Now one day Māra the Evil One, wishing to disturb him, made a fearful noise. The Thera, hearing it, was with his habitual courage unafraid, and knew it was Māra. And to show his contempt he uttered this verse:

## Verses

[49] Not all the clitter-clatter of your noise,\
No more than chirp and squeal of forest sounds,[^2]\
Avail to make pulse throb or mind distraught,\
For one the aim to which my heart is given.

## Attribution

This verse became the Thera's confession of aññā.

## Notes

[^1]: Cf. p. 4; Sisten, p. 60.

[^2]: The limited range, as yet, of Pali lexicography makes it difficult to follow the Commentary's elucidation of sippika . But that the Thera contemptuously likens Māra's 'fearful noise' to minor forest sounds, such as those emitted by monkeys and squirrels, is obvious. The gāthā, barely stated, ia thus: As to the x y noise and the z sounds, that does not make 'throb my heart, for devotion to unity is mine.'
