# Da

## Commentary

He, by his karma, was reborn in the age of our Exalted One at Sāvatthī, as the child of a slave of Anāthapiṇḍika, [22] and was by him appointed as gate-porter of the Vihāra. [^1] Hearing of his virtuous conduct and his wishes, his master made him a freed man, and said, how happy it was to leave the life of the world. He was ordained accordingly; but from that time he grew slothful and slack of effort, taking no steps to roll back the round of rebirth, and sleeping much after meals. At sermon-time he would get into a corner on the outskirts of the congregation, and sit snoring. Now the Exalted One, contemplating his antecedents, spoke the following verse to him in order to stir up agitation:

## Verses

[17] Who waxes slothful and in diet gross,\
Given to sleep and rolling as he lies,\
Like a great hog with provender replete -\
The dolt comes back again, again to birth.

## Attribution

Hearing this, Dasaka grew agitated and, developing insight, not long after realized arahantship. Thereafter he thought 'the verse of the Exalted One became as a goad to me,' and he repeated the verse. Thus, though uttered as a protest concerning food, it became the declaration of his aññā.

## Notes

[^1]: Of the Jetavana. See Sisters for an illustration of the ruins of this famous institution, built by Anāthapiṇḍika. Dasaka = Decimus.
