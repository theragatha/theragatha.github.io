# Khaṇḍasumana

## Commentary

 

Reborn in this Buddha-age at Pāvā in the family of a Malla rāja,[^1] he was named Khaṇḍasumana (Jasmine), because on his birthday the jasmine was in bloom.[^2] He heard the Exalted One while the latter was staying in Cunda's mango grove at Pāvā,[^3] entered the Order, and acquired sixfold abhiññā. Thereupon he remembered his own former births: how he had offered a plant of jasmine at the tope of Kassapa Buddha when all the plucked flowers went to form the king's own offering; and, discerning how this act had guided him to Nibbāna now, he said this verse:

## Verses

[96] One flower in pious offering brought\
Did win me years on years of pleasant life\
In heavenly worlds; the balance hath availed\
To bring me perfect peace and purity.[^4]
