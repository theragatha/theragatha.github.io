## 1.36 Kumā's Son

O goodly are the things our ears now hear!\
O goodly is the life we here may lead!\
O good it is always to lack a house!\
Now questioning on things of high import,\
Now showing all due thanks and reverence:\
Such is the calling of the true recluse,\
Of him who owneth naught of anything.
