## 1.4 Puṇṇa of the Mantānis

Aye with the good consort, with them\

Who strenuous live and lofty vision gain.

Discerns the world's incessant ebb and flow.

Are his, and he hath won the Path of Peace,\
And his the bliss where worldly cares are stilled.

In wisdom strong, guided by virtue's rule, intent,\
To concentration's rapture given, yet vigilant;\
Partaking of such fare as brings thee only good:\

## 1.13 Vanavaccha

Crags with the hue of heaven's blue clouds,\
Where lies enbosomed many a shining tarn\
Of crystal-clear, cool waters, and whose slopes\
The 'herds of Indra' cover and bedeck:\
Those are the braes wherein my soul delights.


## 1.14 Sīvaka

The teacher spake me thus: 'Sīvaka, hence\
Let's go!' Here in the town my body dwells;\
My thoughts are to the forest gone. So thus,\
Prostrated though I be, yet do I go.\
No bond is there for those who understand.


## 1.15 Kuṇḍa-Dhāna</a>

Five cut thou off; Five leave behind, and Five beyond all cultivate!\
He who the Fivefold Bond transcends - a Brother\
Flood-crossed is he called.

E'en as the high-bred steer with crested buck\
Lightly the plough adown the furrow turns,\
So lightly glide for me the nights and days\
Now that this pure untainted bliss is won.


## 1.17 Da

Who waxes slothful and in diet gross,\
Given to sleep and rolling as he lies,\
Like a great hog with provender replete -\
The dolt comes back again, again to birth.


## 1.18 Singāla-Pitar</a>

Lo! in the forest of Bhesakalā\
A brother dwells, heir of the Buddha's grace,\
Suffusing through and through this earthy frame\
With thought intent, austere, of skeleton.\
Beshrew me, if he do not swiftly drive\
All passion of the senses clean away!


## 1.19 Kula

The conduit-makers lead the stream,\
Fletchers coerce the arrow-shaft,\
The joiners mould the wooden plank;\
The self — 'tis that the pious tame.


## 1.20 Ajita

All unafraid of death, nor fain to live,\
I shall lay down this compound frame anon,\
With mind alert, with consciousness controlled.


## 1.21 Nigrodha

No fear have I of fearsome things, for He,\
Our Master, knoweth well th' ambrosial lore.\
The Path where fear nowise a footing finds,\
Along that Path the brethren hold their way.


## 1.22 Cittaka

Peacocks of sapphire neck and comely crest\
Calling, calling in Kāraṇviaa woods;\
By cool and humid winds made musical:\
They wake the thinker from his noonday sleep.


## 1.23 Gosāla

Lo! I who in the bamboo thicket dined\
Off rice and honey, who now comprehend,\
Him worshipping, the ebb and flux of all\
These factors of my life, will hie me back\
Up on my hill, to foster there the growth\
Of heart's detachment, lone and separate.


## 1.24 Suga

Scarce have the rains gone by since I went forth,\
Yet see the seemly order of the Norm!\
The Threefold Wisdom I have I gotten now\
And done all that the Buddha bids us do.

To him whose thought is ever newly born\
From splendour of the Path, and eke hath touched\
The Fruit - if such a Brother thou assail'st,\
Black-hearted sprite, to misery thou must go.

Of him, the Buddha, kin o' th' sun, I heard\
The word most eloquent, and hearing pierced\
The subtle truth of things, as 'twere the tip\
Of hair by cunning bowman's art transfixed.


## 1.27 Lomasakangiya

Dabba and Kusa grass and pricking stems\
And all that hurts in brush and underwood\
Forth from my breast I'll push and thrust away,\
And go where I the growth may cultivate\
Of heart's detachment, lone and separate.


## 1.28 Jambugāmika's

And art thou then not gratified by gear?\
And art thou then not charmed thyself t' adorn?\
And is this fragrant odour, virtue-fraught,\
Wafted by thee, and not by other folk?


## 1.29 Hā

Now bend aloft thyself; e'en as his bolt\
The fletcher, so do thou, O Hārita,\
Make straight thy heart and ignorance cut away.

Since sickness hath befallen me, O now\
Let there arise in me true mindfulness.\
Sickness hath now befallen me - 'tis time\
For me no more to dally or delay.

In the great forest, in the mighty woods,\
Touched though I be by gadfly and by gnat,\
I yet would roam, like warrior-elephant,\
In van of battle, mindful, vigilant.


## 1.32 Suppiya

0 would that I who hourly waste, might change\
For that which ne'er decays - who ever burn,\
Might change for that cool bliss-e'en for the Peace\
That passeth all, Safety beyond compare!

E'en as she would be very good\
Towards her only child, her well-beloved son,\
So too ye should be very good\
Towards all creatures everywhere and everyone.


## 1.34 Posiya

Best when not near, both now and evermore,\
Are such as these for him who understands.\
Forth from the township to the woods I went,\
Thence to my home once more I came; but thence\
Rising I gat me forth again, nor e'er\
Did this same Posiya let fall a word.


## 1.35 Sāmaññakāni

Happiness he who seeks may win an he practise the seeking -\
Honour he gaineth beside, and growth of renown shall befall him -\
So he but practise the road called Straight, even the Ariyan,\
The Noble Eightfold Path whereby we may reach salvation.


## 1.36 Kumā's Son

O goodly are the things our ears now hear!\
O goodly is the life we here may lead!\
O good it is always to lack a house!\
Now questioning on things of high import,\
Now showing all due thanks and reverence:\
Such is the calling of the true recluse,\
Of him who owneth naught of anything.


## 1.37 The Comrade of Kumā's Son

To divers regions back and forth they fare\
Heedless of heart upon their rounds, and balk\
The mind's due concentration. What, forsooth,\
Shall all this vagabondage bring to pass?\
Hence is it meet that clamour be subdued,\
Nor harass him who fain would meditate.


## 1.38 Gavampati

Who by his might reared up the Sarabhū,\
Who standeth self-reliant and unmoved,\
Who hath transcended every tie, Gavampati,\
Him mighty seer the very gods acclaim,\
Surpasser of the coming back to be.

As one whose hair and turban are aflame,\
So let the Brother, mindful and alert,\
Go forth, all worldly passions left behind.

As one downsmitten by impending sword,\
As one whose hair and turban are aflame,\
So let the Brother, mindful and alert,\
Go forth, all lust of living left behind.


## 1.41 Sirivaḍḍha

The lightnings flash e'en in the rocky cave,\
Smiting Vebhāra's crest and Paṇḍava,\
And, in the mountain-bosom hid, a child\
Of that incomparable Master sits\
Ardent in contemplative ecstasy.


## 1.42 Khadira-Vaniya

Come, Cāla, and you, Upacāla too,\
Sīsūpacāla also, take good heed,\
Be on your guard, for he who comes to you\
Is as a wondrous archer splitting hairs.


## 1.43 Sumaṅgala

Well rid, well rid, O excellently rid\
Am I from these three crooked tasks and tools,\
Rid o' my reaping with your sickles, rid\
Of trudging after ploughs, and rid's my back\
Of bending o'er these wretched little spades.\
 Though they be ever here, ay, ever here,\
Enough of them, I say, for me, enough!\
Go meditate, Sumaṅgala, ay, go\
And meditate, Sumaṅgala, and bide\
Earnest and diligent, Sumaṅgala!


## 1.44 Sānu

Do nought of evil, open or concealed,\
If evil thou now doest or wilt do,\
Thou'lt not escape from ill, e'en though thou flee.

 Mother, they weep for the dead, or the living they may not see.\
But for him, O mother, who lives, who is here, why mournest thou me?

They mourn for son who lieth dead, or him\
Who is alive but whom they no more see.\
And him they mourn, who though he did renounce\
The world, my son, doth hither come again,\
For though he live again, yet is he dead.\
Drawn forth from burning embers, O my dear,\
Dost thou on embers wish to fall again?


## 1.45 Ramaṇīyavihārin

E'en though he trip and fall, the mettled brute\
Of noble breed will steadfast stand once more.\
So look on me as one who having learned\
Of Him, the All-Enlightened One, have gained\
True insight, am become of noble breed,\
And of the Very Buddha very child.


## 1.46 Samiddhi

In trust and hope forth from my home I came\
Into the homeless life. And there in me\
Have mindfulness and insight grown, and tense\
And well composed my heart and mind. Make thou\
Whatever shams thou list, thou'lt harm me not.


## 1.47 Ujjaya

Buddha the Wake, the Hero hail! all hail!\
Thou who from every bond art wholly free!\
Strong in the lore I learnt of thee, I live\
From fourfold venom cleansed, sane, immune.


## 1.48 Sañjaya

Since I went forth from home to homeless life,\
Ne'er have I harboured conscious wish or plan\
Un-Ariyan, or linked with enmity.


## 1.49 Rāmaṇeyyaka

Not all the clitter-clatter of your noise,\
No more than chirp and squeal of forest sounds,\
Avail to make pulse throb or mind distraught,\
For one the aim to which my heart is given.


## 1.50 Vimala




## 1.55 Añjana-vaniya</a>

Deep in the leafy glndes of Añjana\
My couch into a little hut I made.\
The threefold wisdom have I made my own,\
And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.


## 1.56 Kuṭivihārin</a>

Who's in my little hut? A brother 'tis,\
Who in thy little hut, all passions tamed,\
Hath throughly set his mind. Know this, O friend,\
'Twas not for naught thou mad'st thy little hut!

Within the hut a brother dwells, peace in his heart, purged of all taint.\
Fruit of this deed shall be to thee: lord of the gods thou'll come to be\
Six times, ay, seven, lord of the gods, ruler over celestial realms,\
Thereafter all thy passions tamed, a Silent Buddha thou shalt be.


## 1.57 Kuṭivihārin (2)

This was an ancient hut, say'st thou? To build\
Auother hut, a new one, is thy wish?\
O cast away the longing for a hut!\
New hut will bring new pain, brother, to thee.


## 1.58 Ramaṇīyakuṭika

Delightful is my little hut, the gift\
Most fair of faithful, pious folk.\
What need of maidens then have I? Nay, go\
Thither to them, ye women, who have need of you.


## 1.59 Kosalavihārin

Strong in my faith I left the world. Now here\
Within the woods a hut is made for me;\
And I with zeal and ardour meditate,\
With watchful wit and clarity of mind.


## 1.60 Sī

Now have they prospered, all my highest aims,\
To compass which I sought this still retreat.\
The holy lore and liberty, my quest,\
All lurking vain conceits I cast away.


## 1.61 V

He who doth see can see another seer,\
Him too who hath no eyes wherewith to see,\
He who himself sees not, can ne'er discern\
Either the eye that sees not, or the seer.


## 1.62 Vajji-putta

Each by himself we in the forest dwell,\
Like logs rejected by the woodman's craft.\
So flit the days one like another by,\
Who more unlucky in their lot than we?

 Each by himself we in the forest dwell,\
Like logs rejected by the woodman's craft.\
And many a one doth envy me my lot,\
E'en as the hell-bound him who fares to heaven.


## 1.63 Pakkha (The Cripple)

They fly at what is fall'n, and as it lies,\
Swooping in greed they come again, again. ...\
But what 'twas meet to do, that have I done,\
And what is verily delectable,\
Therein was my delight: thus happily\
Has happiness been sought after and won.


## 1.64 Vimala-Kondañña

By the bright Banner came I here to birth\
In her called of the Tree. And by the FLAG\
That smites the flag, is the great Flag o'er-thrown.

That heaped wealth by Vaccha's toil thrown up\
By steady increment these many years,\
That doth he to the laity declare,\
Seated in honour, filled with splendid joy.


## 1.66 Meg

He, the great Hero, counselled me, whose mind\
Hath all transcended that our minds may know.\

In loving pupillage and piety.\
The threefold wisdom have I made my own,\
And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.


## 1.67 Ekadhamma Sava

Impermanent indeed are all component things

 Burnt up in me is all that doth defile,\
And rooted out all life's continuance;\
Slain utterly the cycle of re-birth:\
Now is there no more coming back to be.


## 1.68 Ekudāniya

He who doth dwell on highest plane of thought, etc.

 He who doth dwell on highest plane of thought,\

In wisdom's branches trained: - such as he is,\
No sorrows may beset him, who with mind\
Calm and serene and clear abideth aye.


## 1.69 Channa

I heard the Truth which that Great One had taught,\
And felt its mighty virtues, known by Him\

The Path for winning things ambrosial\
I found. Past-master He in sooth to guide\
Into the way of blest security.


## 1.70 Puṇṇa

Only virtue here is highest; but the wise man is supreme.\
He who wisdom hath and virtue,\
He 'mong men and gods is victor.


## 1.71 Vaccha

Is there a man who can the truth discern\
Tho' it be very subtle and refined,\
Who, skilled to measure spiritual growth,\
Is yet of lowly and of gentle mind,\
Who shapes his life by rule of Them that Wake:\
For him Nibbāna is not hard to find.


## 1.72 Ātuma

As the new bamboo-stem, even when grown\
To its full knotted height, can scarce emerge,\
So I by all this bringing home of brides -\
Give me your leave! Gone forth e'en now am I.


## 1.73 Māṇava

And from me put away the enticing sweets of sense-desire.

Turmoil of any kind and doubt are dead.

Doubt is cut off, and wisdom grows apace.\
E'en of a fool they make an able man;\
Hence goodly is the intercourse with saints.


## 1.76 Piyañjaha

Where men are arrogant, see thou lie low.\
Where they are low in mind, lift up the heart.\
Dwell thou where other folk care not to dwell,\
Wherein men find delight, take thou no joy.


## 1.77 Hatthāroha-Putta

Once roamed this heart a field, a wanderer\
Wherever will, or whim, or pleasure led.\
To-day that heart I'll hold in thorough check,\

Nor found a clue. Lo! now from me who sore\
Have suffered is the load of ill withdrawn.

Ill will for ever have I rooted out;\
Illusion utterly has passed from me;\
Cool am I now. Gone out all fire within.

All action wrought by me and bringing birth,\
Whether 'twas of great potency or small,\
Shattered and ended is it utterly.\

In former births by me, just here and now,\

Where'er 'tis safe and free from peril, there\
Go thou, my boy; vex not thy life with care.

O Siha! persevere in earnestness;\
By night and day abide unfaltering.\
Engender the good Norm within thy heart.\
Swiftly renounce that piled up base of birth.

Who lov'st the day 'mid chattering crowds to spend: -\
Dost deem that thou this way at any time,\
Poor silly fool, of Ill shalt make an end?

Expert to grasp the image conjured up,\
Versed in the secret of the life detached,\
Practised in contemplation, clear in mind: -\
Well may he win to rapture unalloyed.


## 1.86 Nāgita

Outside our Order many others be, who teach\
A path never, like this one, to Nibbāna leading.\
But us the Exalted One, the blessed Master's self\
Instructs as 'twere by just the palm o' th' hand outspreading.

Myself forth from the waters on dry land.\

To know the Truths, their truth to understand.

Past doom infernal am I safely come\
From flood and fetter dire to liberty,\

Himself revealed to me the holy Norm.


## 1.92 Vijaya

In whom the intoxicants are dried up;\

Whose range is in the Void and the Unmarked\
And Liberty: - as flight of birds in air\
So hard is it to track the trail of him.


## 1.93 Eraka

Woeful are worldly wishes, Eraka!\

To bring me perfect peace and purity.


## 1.97 Tissa

Renouncing costly vessels wrought in bronze,\
In gold, I grasped this earthen bowl.\
The second time was I anointed then.


## 1.98 Abhaya (2)

Sight of fair shape bewildering self-control,\
If one but heed the image sweet and dear,\
The heart inflamed in feeling doth o'erflow\
And clinging stayeth. Thus in him do grow\
The deadly taints that bring new living near.


## 1.99 Uttiya

Sound of sweet voice bewildering self-control,\
If one but think upon the image dear,\

He with fair flowers of Liberty enwreathed,\

Though layman's life be left, yet if the task\
Remain undone, the mouth harsh furrows plough,\
The paunch be full, the mind all slack with sloth: -\
Like a great hog with provender replete,\
He cometh back, again, again to birth.


## 1.102 Setuccha

By vain conceits deluded, and their wits\
Corrupted by the varied things of sense;\
Flushed by their gains, by dearth thereof upset,\
They fail to win the concentrated mind.

Nay, 'tis not this I need, who live in bliss,\
Regaled by sweetest nectar of the Norm.\
Drinking those drops peerless, supreme, shall I\
Forsooth my tongue with poison now acquaint?

Buoyant in sooth my body, every pulse\
Throbbing in wondrous bliss and ecstasy.\
Even as cotton-down blown on the breeze,\
So floats and hovers this my body light.

Where I am straitened let me never dwell,\
Let me go thence, if life too pleasant prove.\
Ne'er will the man with eyes to see abide\
Where aught may hinder in the quest supreme.

Betray wherein the hidden meaning lies.\
Whoso hath eyes to see but one, a dullard is,\
Who can discern the hundred, he is wise.

I pondered well, then sought the life that lay\
Beyond the walls and bonds of household life.\

A hundred years was I and eke a score,\
When forth I went and knew my home no more.\

## 1.109 Saṅgha-Rakkhita

Con o'er the system by that Blest One (planned)\
Who showed compassion for our highest good.\
Still are his powers relaxed and uncontrolled,\
Like woodland doe all tender grown and weak.

The trees on high by towering cloud refreshed\
With the new rain break forth in verdant growth.\
To Usabha who for detachment longs,\
And hath the forest sense of things, doth come\
 abundant good.


## 1.111 Jenta

Hard is the life without the world, and hard\
In sooth to bear house life. Deep is the Norm;\

The choice of one or other how to live.\
Behoves me bear unceasingly in mind\
 Impermanence.


## 1.112 Vacchag

The Threefold Lore is mine, and I excel\
In Jhāna-ecstasy, adept in calm\
Of balanced mind. Salvation have I won,\
And all the Buddha-ordinance is done.


## 1.113 Vanavaccha (2)

Crags where clear waters lie, a rocky world,\
Haunted by black-faced apes and timid deer,\
Where 'neath bright blossoms run the silver streams:\
Those are the highlands of my heart's delight.


## 1.114 Adhimutta</a>

If ye to this gross body give such heed,\
Greedy its pleasures to enjoy, the while\
Life's energies do ebb away, O whence\
Shall come perfection in the holy life?


## 1.115 Mahanāma

Lo thou! how to a wretched end art come\
By this steep crag, this famous Hunter's Hill,\
Its many crests begirt by sāl-tree woods,\
 clothed!


## 1.116 Pāpāpariya

Avoiding truck with contact's sixfold field,\
Guarding the gates of sense, master of self,\
The general root of misery vomiting,\
From every poison-taint am I immune.


## 1.117 

With perfumed skin and delicately clad\
And head ablaze with gems, natheless my way\
I found and made the Threefold Lore my own;\
And now the Buddha-ordinance is done.


## 1.118 Kim

As bidden by some power age o'er her falls.\
Her shape is as another, yet the same.\
Now this my self, who ne'er have left myself,\
Seems other than the self I recollect.


## 1.119 Vajji-putta (2)

Come thou and plunge in leafy lair of trees,\
Suffer Nibbāna in thy heart to sink!\
Study and dally not, thou Gotamid!\
What doth this fingle-fangle mean to thee?


## 1.120 Isidatta

The factors of my life well understood\
Stand yet a little while with severed root.\
Sorrow is slain! that quest I've won, and won\
Is purity from fourfold Venom's stain.


## 1.1 Subhūti

Well-roofed and pleasant is my little hut,\
And screened from winds - Rain at thy will, thou god!\
My heart is well composed, my heart is free,\
And ardent is my mood. Now rain, god! rain.


## 1.2 Koṭṭhita the Great

Whoso, serene and calm, dead to the world,\
Can utter wisdom's runes, with wit unswelled.\
Unruffled - he doth shake off naughty things\
As they were forest leaves by wind-god blown.


## 1.3 Kankhā-Revata

Behold how great the wisdom is of Them\
Who Thus-have-come! As fire at midnight hour,\
Givers of light, givers of sight are they\
To those that pass, subduing all their doubt.


## 1.4 Puṇṇa of the Mantānis

Aye with the good consort, with them\
Who know, who understand, who see the Good.\
Great is the Good and deep and hard to see,\
Subtle and delicately fine, to which\
The wise and brave do penetrate, e'en they\
Who strenuous live and lofty vision gain.


## 1.5 Dabba

Once hard to tame, by taming tamed is now\
Dabba, from doubts released, content, serene.\
Victor is Dabba now, and void of fears;\
Perfected he and staunch in steadfastness.


## 1.6 Sīta-Vaniya

There is a brother who to Cool Wood gone doth dwell\
Alone, content, in meditative ecstasy,\
Victorious, no more by creeping dread dismayed,\
He mindful watcheth over sense with courage high.


## 1.7 Bhalliya

Whoso hath chased away the Death-king and his host,\
E'en as a mighty flood the causeway of frail reeds,\
Victor is he, self-tamed. Fear cometh never more.\
His is the Goal supreme, and utter steadfastness.


## 1.8 Vīra

Once hard to tame, by taming now is tamed\
Vira, from doubts released, content, serene;\
Victor is Vira, free from creeping dread;\
His is the goal supreme, and steadfast strength.


## 1.9 Pilinda-Vaccha

O welcome this that came, nor came amiss!\
0 goodly was the counsel given to me!\
'Mong divers doctrines mooted among men\
Of all 'twas sure the Best I sought and found.


## 1.10 Puṇṇamāsa

All longings as to this or other life\
Have I put far from me, as one who hath\
Beta'en himself to truth, whose heart's at peace,\
Who, self-subdued, in all things undefiled,\
Discerns the world's incessant ebb and flow.


## 1.11 Gavaccha the Less

Abundantly this brother doth rejoice,\
For the blest truths the Buddha hath revealed\
Are his, and he hath won the Path of Peace,\
And his the bliss where worldly cares are stilled.


## 1.12 Gavaccha Major

In wisdom strong, guided by virtue's rule, intent,\
To concentration's rapture given, yet vigilant;\
Partaking of such fare as brings thee only good:\
So in the faith, with passions quenched, await the hour.


## 1.13 Vanavaccha

Crags with the hue of heaven's blue clouds,\
Where lies enbosomed many a shining tarn\
Of crystal-clear, cool waters, and whose slopes\
The 'herds of Indra' cover and bedeck:\
Those are the braes wherein my soul delights.


## 1.14 Sīvaka

The teacher spake me thus: 'Sīvaka, hence\
Let's go!' Here in the town my body dwells;\
My thoughts are to the forest gone. So thus,\
Prostrated though I be, yet do I go.\
No bond is there for those who understand.


## 1.15 Kuṇḍa-Dhāna</a>

Five cut thou off; Five leave behind, and Five beyond all cultivate!\
He who the Fivefold Bond transcends - a Brother\
Flood-crossed is he called.


## 1.16 Belaṭṭhasīsa

E'en as the high-bred steer with crested buck\
Lightly the plough adown the furrow turns,\
So lightly glide for me the nights and days\
Now that this pure untainted bliss is won.


## 1.17 Da

Who waxes slothful and in diet gross,\
Given to sleep and rolling as he lies,\
Like a great hog with provender replete -\
The dolt comes back again, again to birth.


## 1.18 Singāla-Pitar</a>

Lo! in the forest of Bhesakalā\
A brother dwells, heir of the Buddha's grace,\
Suffusing through and through this earthy frame\
With thought intent, austere, of skeleton.\
Beshrew me, if he do not swiftly drive\
All passion of the senses clean away!


## 1.19 Kula

The conduit-makers lead the stream,\
Fletchers coerce the arrow-shaft,\
The joiners mould the wooden plank;\
The self — 'tis that the pious tame.


## 1.20 Ajita

All unafraid of death, nor fain to live,\
I shall lay down this compound frame anon,\
With mind alert, with consciousness controlled.


## 1.21 Nigrodha

No fear have I of fearsome things, for He,\
Our Master, knoweth well th' ambrosial lore.\
The Path where fear nowise a footing finds,\
Along that Path the brethren hold their way.


## 1.22 Cittaka

Peacocks of sapphire neck and comely crest\
Calling, calling in Kāraṇviaa woods;\
By cool and humid winds made musical:\
They wake the thinker from his noonday sleep.


## 1.23 Gosāla

Lo! I who in the bamboo thicket dined\
Off rice and honey, who now comprehend,\
Him worshipping, the ebb and flux of all\
These factors of my life, will hie me back\
Up on my hill, to foster there the growth\
Of heart's detachment, lone and separate.


## 1.24 Suga

Scarce have the rains gone by since I went forth,\
Yet see the seemly order of the Norm!\
The Threefold Wisdom I have I gotten now\
And done all that the Buddha bids us do.


## 1.25 Nan

To him whose thought is ever newly born\
From splendour of the Path, and eke hath touched\
The Fruit - if such a Brother thou assail'st,\
Black-hearted sprite, to misery thou must go.


## 1.26 Ab

Of him, the Buddha, kin o' th' sun, I heard\
The word most eloquent, and hearing pierced\
The subtle truth of things, as 'twere the tip\
Of hair by cunning bowman's art transfixed.


## 1.27 Lomasakangiya

Dabba and Kusa grass and pricking stems\
And all that hurts in brush and underwood\
Forth from my breast I'll push and thrust away,\
And go where I the growth may cultivate\
Of heart's detachment, lone and separate.


## 1.28 Jambugāmika's

And art thou then not gratified by gear?\
And art thou then not charmed thyself t' adorn?\
And is this fragrant odour, virtue-fraught,\
Wafted by thee, and not by other folk?


## 1.29 Hā

Now bend aloft thyself; e'en as his bolt\
The fletcher, so do thou, O Hārita,\
Make straight thy heart and ignorance cut away.


## 1.30 Uttiya

Since sickness hath befallen me, O now\
Let there arise in me true mindfulness.\
Sickness hath now befallen me - 'tis time\
For me no more to dally or delay.

Of heart's detachment, lone and separate.


## 1.1 Subhūti

Well-roofed and pleasant is my little hut,\
And screened from winds - Rain at thy will, thou god!\
My heart is well composed, my heart is free,\
And ardent is my mood. Now rain, god! rain.


## 1.2 Koṭṭhita the Great

Whoso, serene and calm, dead to the world,\
Can utter wisdom's runes, with wit unswelled.\
Unruffled - he doth shake off naughty things\
As they were forest leaves by wind-god blown.


## 1.3 Kankhā-Revata

Behold how great the wisdom is of Them\
Who Thus-have-come! As fire at midnight hour,\
Givers of light, givers of sight are they\
To those that pass, subduing all their doubt.


## 1.4 Puṇṇa of the Mantānis

Aye with the good consort, with them\
Who know, who understand, who see the Good.\
Great is the Good and deep and hard to see,\
Subtle and delicately fine, to which\
The wise and brave do penetrate, e'en they\
Who strenuous live and lofty vision gain.

Once hard to tame, by taming tamed is now\
Dabba, from doubts released, content, serene.\

Perfected he and staunch in steadfastness.

There is a brother who to Cool Wood gone doth dwell\
Alone, content, in meditative ecstasy,\
Victorious, no more by creeping dread dismayed,\
He mindful watcheth over sense with courage high.

E'en as a mighty flood the causeway of frail reeds,\

O welcome this that came, nor came amiss!\
0 goodly was the counsel given to me!\
'Mong divers doctrines mooted among men\
Of all 'twas sure the Best I sought and found.


## 1.10 Puṇṇamāsa

All longings as to this or other life\
Have I put far from me, as one who hath\
Beta'en himself to truth, whose heart's at peace,\
Who, self-subdued, in all things undefiled,\
Discerns the world's incessant ebb and flow.


## 1.11 Gavaccha the Less

Abundantly this brother doth rejoice,\
For the blest truths the Buddha hath revealed\
Are his, and he hath won the Path of Peace,\
And his the bliss where worldly cares are stilled.


## 1.12 Gavaccha Major

In wisdom strong, guided by virtue's rule, intent,\
To concentration's rapture given, yet vigilant;\
Partaking of such fare as brings thee only good:\
So in the faith, with passions quenched, await the hour.


## 1.13 Vanavaccha

Crags with the hue of heaven's blue clouds,\
Where lies enbosomed many a shining tarn\
Of crystal-clear, cool waters, and whose slopes\
The 'herds of Indra' cover and bedeck:\
Those are the braes wherein my soul delights.


## 1.14 Sīvaka

The teacher spake me thus: 'Sīvaka, hence\
Let's go!' Here in the town my body dwells;\
My thoughts are to the forest gone. So thus,\
Prostrated though I be, yet do I go.\
No bond is there for those who understand.


## 1.15 Kuṇḍa-Dhāna

Five cut thou off; Five leave behind, and Five beyond all cultivate!\
He who the Fivefold Bond transcends - a Brother\
Flood-crossed is he called.


## 1.16 Belaṭṭhasīsa

E'en as the high-bred steer with crested buck\
Lightly the plough adown the furrow turns,\
So lightly glide for me the nights and days\
Now that this pure untainted bliss is won.


## 1.17 Dasaka

Who waxes slothful and in diet gross,\
Given to sleep and rolling as he lies,\
Like a great hog with provender replete -\
The dolt comes back again, again to birth.


## 1.18 Singāla-Pitar

Lo! in the forest of Bhesakalā\
A brother dwells, heir of the Buddha's grace,\
Suffusing through and through this earthy frame\
With thought intent, austere, of skeleton.\
Beshrew me, if he do not swiftly drive\
All passion of the senses clean away!


## 1.19 Kula

The conduit-makers lead the stream,\
Fletchers coerce the arrow-shaft,\
The joiners mould the wooden plank;\
The self — 'tis that the pious tame.


## 1.20 Ajita

All unafraid of death, nor fain to live,\
I shall lay down this compound frame anon,\
With mind alert, with consciousness controlled.


## 1.21 Nigrodha

No fear have I of fearsome things, for He,\
Our Master, knoweth well th' ambrosial lore.\
The Path where fear nowise a footing finds,\
Along that Path the brethren hold their way.


## 1.22 Cittaka

Peacocks of sapphire neck and comely crest\
Calling, calling in Kāraṇviaa woods;\
By cool and humid winds made musical:\
They wake the thinker from his noonday sleep.


## 1.23 Gosāla

Lo! I who in the bamboo thicket dined\
Off rice and honey, who now comprehend,\
Him worshipping, the ebb and flux of all\
These factors of my life, will hie me back\
Up on my hill, to foster there the growth\
Of heart's detachment, lone and separate.


## 1.24 Sugandha

Scarce have the rains gone by since I went forth,\
Yet see the seemly order of the Norm!\
The Threefold Wisdom I have I gotten now\
And done all that the Buddha bids us do.


## 1.25 Nandiya

To him whose thought is ever newly born\
From splendour of the Path, and eke hath touched\
The Fruit - if such a Brother thou assail'st,\
Black-hearted sprite, to misery thou must go.


## 1.26 Abhaya

Of him, the Buddha, kin o' th' sun, I heard\
The word most eloquent, and hearing pierced\
The subtle truth of things, as 'twere the tip\
Of hair by cunning bowman's art transfixed.


## 1.27 Lomasakangiya

Dabba and Kusa grass and pricking stems\
And all that hurts in brush and underwood\
Forth from my breast I'll push and thrust away,\
And go where I the growth may cultivate\
Of heart's detachment, lone and separate.


## 1.28 Jambugāmika's Son

And art thou then not gratified by gear?\
And art thou then not charmed thyself t' adorn?\
And is this fragrant odour, virtue-fraught,\
Wafted by thee, and not by other folk?


## 1.29 Hārita

Now bend aloft thyself; e'en as his bolt\
The fletcher, so do thou, O Hārita,\
Make straight thy heart and ignorance cut away.

Since sickness hath befallen me, O now\
Let there arise in me true mindfulness.\
Sickness hath now befallen me - 'tis time\
For me no more to dally or delay.

In the great forest, in the mighty woods,\
Touched though I be by gadfly and by gnat,\
I yet would roam, like warrior-elephant,\
In van of battle, mindful, vigilant.


## 1.32 Suppiya

0 would that I who hourly waste, might change\
For that which ne'er decays - who ever burn,\
Might change for that cool bliss-e'en for the Peace\
That passeth all, Safety beyond compare!

E'en as she would be very good\
Towards her only child, her well-beloved son,\
So too ye should be very good\
Towards all creatures everywhere and everyone.


## 1.34 Posiya

Best when not near, both now and evermore,\
Are such as these for him who understands.\
Forth from the township to the woods I went,\
Thence to my home once more I came; but thence\
Rising I gat me forth again, nor e'er\
Did this same Posiya let fall a word.


## 1.35 Sāmaññakāni

Happiness he who seeks may win an he practise the seeking -\
Honour he gaineth beside, and growth of renown shall befall him -\
So he but practise the road called Straight, even the Ariyan,\
The Noble Eightfold Path whereby we may reach salvation.


## 1.36 Kumā's Son

O goodly are the things our ears now hear!\
O goodly is the life we here may lead!\
O good it is always to lack a house!\
Now questioning on things of high import,\
Now showing all due thanks and reverence:\
Such is the calling of the true recluse,\
Of him who owneth naught of anything.


## 1.37 The Comrade of Kumā's Son

To divers regions back and forth they fare\
Heedless of heart upon their rounds, and balk\
The mind's due concentration. What, forsooth,\
Shall all this vagabondage bring to pass?\
Hence is it meet that clamour be subdued,\
Nor harass him who fain would meditate.


## 1.38 Gavampati

Who by his might reared up the Sarabhū,\
Who standeth self-reliant and unmoved,\

The lightnings flash e'en in the rocky cave,\
Smiting Vebhāra's crest and Paṇḍava,\

Of that incomparable Master sits\
Ardent in contemplative ecstasy.


## 1.42 Khadira-Vaniya

Come, Cāla, and you, Upacāla too,\
Sīsūpacāla also, take good heed,\
Be on your guard, for he who comes to you\
Is as a wondrous archer splitting hairs.


## 1.43 Sumaṅgala

Well rid, well rid, O excellently rid\
Am I from these three crooked tasks and tools,\
Rid o' my reaping with your sickles, rid\
Of trudging after ploughs, and rid's my back\
Of bending o'er these wretched little spades.\
 Though they be ever here, ay, ever here,\
Enough of them, I say, for me, enough!\
Go meditate, Sumaṅgala, ay, go\
And meditate, Sumaṅgala, and bide\
Earnest and diligent, Sumaṅgala!


## 1.44 Sānu

Do nought of evil, open or concealed,\
If evil thou now doest or wilt do,\
Thou'lt not escape from ill, e'en though thou flee.

 Mother, they weep for the dead, or the living they may not see.\
But for him, O mother, who lives, who is here, why mournest thou me?

They mourn for son who lieth dead, or him\
Who is alive but whom they no more see.\
And him they mourn, who though he did renounce\
The world, my son, doth hither come again,\
For though he live again, yet is he dead.\
Drawn forth from burning embers, O my dear,\
Dost thou on embers wish to fall again?


## 1.45 Ramaṇīyavihārin

E'en though he trip and fall, the mettled brute\
Of noble breed will steadfast stand once more.\
So look on me as one who having learned\
Of Him, the All-Enlightened One, have gained\
True insight, am become of noble breed,\
And of the Very Buddha very child.


## 1.46 Samiddhi

In trust and hope forth from my home I came\
Into the homeless life. And there in me\
Have mindfulness and insight grown, and tense\
And well composed my heart and mind. Make thou\
Whatever shams thou list, thou'lt harm me not.


## 1.47 Ujjaya

Buddha the Wake, the Hero hail! all hail!\
Thou who from every bond art wholly free!\
Strong in the lore I learnt of thee, I live\
From fourfold venom cleansed, sane, immune.


## 1.48 Sañjaya

Since I went forth from home to homeless life,\
Ne'er have I harboured conscious wish or plan\
Un-Ariyan, or linked with enmity.


## 1.49 Rāmaṇeyyaka

Not all the clitter-clatter of your noise,\
No more than chirp and squeal of forest sounds,\
Avail to make pulse throb or mind distraught,\
For one the aim to which my heart is given.


## 1.50 Vimala




## 1.55 Añjana-vaniya

Deep in the leafy glndes of Añjana\
My couch into a little hut I made.\
The threefold wisdom have I made my own,\
And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.


## 1.56 Kuṭivihārin

Who's in my little hut? A brother 'tis,\
Who in thy little hut, all passions tamed,\
Hath throughly set his mind. Know this, O friend,\
'Twas not for naught thou mad'st thy little hut!

Within the hut a brother dwells, peace in his heart, purged of all taint.\
Fruit of this deed shall be to thee: lord of the gods thou'll come to be\
Six times, ay, seven, lord of the gods, ruler over celestial realms,\
Thereafter all thy passions tamed, a Silent Buddha thou shalt be.


## 1.57 Kuṭivihārin (2)

This was an ancient hut, say'st thou? To build\
Auother hut, a new one, is thy wish?\
O cast away the longing for a hut!\
New hut will bring new pain, brother, to thee.


## 1.58 Ramaṇīyakuṭika

Delightful is my little hut, the gift\
Most fair of faithful, pious folk.\
What need of maidens then have I? Nay, go\
Thither to them, ye women, who have need of you.


## 1.59 Kosalavihārin

Strong in my faith I left the world. Now here\
Within the woods a hut is made for me;\
And I with zeal and ardour meditate,\
With watchful wit and clarity of mind.


## 1.60 Sīvali

Now have they prospered, all my highest aims,\
To compass which I sought this still retreat.\
The holy lore and liberty, my quest,\
All lurking vain conceits I cast away.


## 1.61 Vappa

He who doth see can see another seer,\
Him too who hath no eyes wherewith to see,\
He who himself sees not, can ne'er discern\
Either the eye that sees not, or the seer.


## 1.62 Vajji-putta

Each by himself we in the forest dwell,\
Like logs rejected by the woodman's craft.\
So flit the days one like another by,\
Who more unlucky in their lot than we?

 Each by himself we in the forest dwell,\
Like logs rejected by the woodman's craft.\
And many a one doth envy me my lot,\
E'en as the hell-bound him who fares to heaven.


## 1.63 Pakkha (The Cripple)

They fly at what is fall'n, and as it lies,\
Swooping in greed they come again, again. ...\
But what 'twas meet to do, that have I done,\
And what is verily delectable,\
Therein was my delight: thus happily\
Has happiness been sought after and won.


## 1.64 Vimala-Kondañña

By the bright Banner came I here to birth\
In her called of the Tree. And by the FLAG\
That smites the flag, is the great Flag o'er-thrown.


## 1.65 Ukkhepakata-Vaccha

That heaped wealth by Vaccha's toil thrown up\
By steady increment these many years,\
That doth he to the laity declare,\
Seated in honour, filled with splendid joy.


## 1.66 Meghiya

He, the great Hero, counselled me, whose mind\
Hath all transcended that our minds may know.\
And I, hearing the Norm, held close to Him\
In loving pupillage and piety.\
The threefold wisdom have I made my own,\
And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.


## 1.67 Ekadhamma Savanīya

Impermanent indeed are all component things

 Burnt up in me is all that doth defile,\
And rooted out all life's continuance;\
Slain utterly the cycle of re-birth:\
Now is there no more coming back to be.


## 1.68 Ekudāniya

He who doth dwell on highest plane of thought, etc.

 He who doth dwell on highest plane of thought,\

In wisdom's branches trained: - such as he is,\
No sorrows may beset him, who with mind\
Calm and serene and clear abideth aye.


## 1.69 Channa

I heard the Truth which that Great One had taught,\
And felt its mighty virtues, known by Him\

I found. Past-master He in sooth to guide\
Into the way of blest security.

Only virtue here is highest; but the wise man is supreme.\
He who wisdom hath and virtue,\
He 'mong men and gods is victor.

Is there a man who can the truth discern\
Tho' it be very subtle and refined,\
Who, skilled to measure spiritual growth,\
Is yet of lowly and of gentle mind,\
Who shapes his life by rule of Them that Wake:\
For him Nibbāna is not hard to find.


## 1.72 Ātuma

As the new bamboo-stem, even when grown\
To its full knotted height, can scarce emerge,\
So I by all this bringing home of brides -\
Give me your leave! Gone forth e'en now am I.

Turmoil of any kind and doubt are dead.

Doubt is cut off, and wisdom grows apace.\
E'en of a fool they make an able man;\
Hence goodly is the intercourse with saints.

Where men are arrogant, see thou lie low.\
Where they are low in mind, lift up the heart.\
Dwell thou where other folk care not to dwell,\
Wherein men find delight, take thou no joy.

Once roamed this heart a field, a wanderer\
Wherever will, or whim, or pleasure led.\

In former births by me, just here and now,\

Where'er 'tis safe and free from peril, there\
Go thou, my boy; vex not thy life with care.

By night and day abide unfaltering.\
Engender the good Norm within thy heart.\
Swiftly renounce that piled up base of birth.

Who lov'st the day 'mid chattering crowds to spend: -\
Dost deem that thou this way at any time,\
Poor silly fool, of Ill shalt make an end?

Expert to grasp the image conjured up,\
Versed in the secret of the life detached,\
Practised in contemplation, clear in mind: -\
Well may he win to rapture unalloyed.

To know the Truths, their truth to understand.

Past doom infernal am I safely come\
From flood and fetter dire to liberty,\

Could I o'errate what I partook to-day,\
When He, the all-seeing Gotama, the Buddha blest,\
Himself revealed to me the holy Norm.


## 1.92 Vijaya

In whom the intoxicants are dried up;\
Whose happiness dependeth not on food;\
Whose range is in the Void and the Unmarked\
And Liberty: - as flight of birds in air\
So hard is it to track the trail of him.


## 1.93 Eraka

Woeful are worldly wishes, Eraka!\
No weal in worldly wishes, Eraka!\

Our splendid Lord, the Sākiyas' son!\
For he the topmost height hath won,\
And well the Norm supreme hath shown.


## 1.95 Cakkhupāla

All blind am I and perished are mine eyes\
And through the jungle's wilderness I fare.\
E'en then I'll go, and were it lying down,\
But not with child of evil as my mate.


## 1.96 Khaṇḍasumana

One flower in pious offering brought\
Did win me years on years of pleasant life\
In heavenly worlds; the balance hath availed\
To bring me perfect peace and purity.


## 1.97 Tissa

Renouncing costly vessels wrought in bronze,\
In gold, I grasped this earthen bowl.\
The second time was I anointed then.


## 1.98 Abhaya (2)

Sight of fair shape bewildering self-control,\
If one but heed the image sweet and dear,\
The heart inflamed in feeling doth o'erflow\
And clinging stayeth. Thus in him do grow\
The deadly taints that bring new living near.


## 1.99 Uttiya

Sound of sweet voice bewildering self-control,\
If one but think upon the image dear,\
The heart inflamed in feeling doth o'erflow\
And clinging stayeth. Thus in him do grow\
The deadly taints that bring Saṇsāra near.


## 1.100 Devasabha (2)

Whoso supreme endeavour doth put forth,\
Whose range is in the fourfold heedfulness,\
He with fair flowers of Liberty enwreathed,\
Sane and immune, will reach the perfect peace.


## 1.101 Belaṭṭhakāni

Though layman's life be left, yet if the task\
Remain undone, the mouth harsh furrows plough,\
The paunch be full, the mind all slack with sloth: -\
Like a great hog with provender replete,\
He cometh back, again, again to birth.


## 1.102 Setuccha

By vain conceits deluded, and their wits\
Corrupted by the varied things of sense;\
Flushed by their gains, by dearth thereof upset,\
They fail to win the concentrated mind.


## 1.103 Bandhura

Nay, 'tis not this I need, who live in bliss,\
Regaled by sweetest nectar of the Norm.\
Drinking those drops peerless, supreme, shall I\
Forsooth my tongue with poison now acquaint?


## 1.104 Khitaka

Buoyant in sooth my body, every pulse\
Throbbing in wondrous bliss and ecstasy.\
Even as cotton-down blown on the breeze,\
So floats and hovers this my body light.


## 1.105 Malitavambha

Where I am straitened let me never dwell,\
Let me go thence, if life too pleasant prove.\
Ne'er will the man with eyes to see abide\
Where aught may hinder in the quest supreme.


## 1.106 Suhemanta

A hundred tokens show, a hundred marks\
Betray wherein the hidden meaning lies.\
Whoso hath eyes to see but one, a dullard is,\
Who can discern the hundred, he is wise.


## 1.107 Dhammāsava

I pondered well, then sought the life that lay\
Beyond the walls and bonds of household life.\
The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,\
And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.


## 1.108 Dhammāsava's Father

A hundred years was I and eke a score,\
When forth I went and knew my home no more.\
The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,\
And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.


## 1.109 Saṅgha-Rakkhita

Not yet doth he, though in retreat he dwell,\
Con o'er the system by that Blest One (planned)\
Who showed compassion for our highest good.\
Still are his powers relaxed and uncontrolled,\
Like woodland doe all tender grown and weak.


## 1.110 Usabha

The trees on high by towering cloud refreshed\
With the new rain break forth in verdant growth.\
To Usabha who for detachment longs,\
And hath the forest sense of things, doth come\
 abundant good.


## 1.111 Jenta

Hard is the life without the world, and hard\
In sooth to bear house life. Deep is the Norm;\
Hard too is wealth to win. Thus difficult\
The choice of one or other how to live.\
Behoves me bear unceasingly in mind\
 Impermanence.


## 1.112 Vacchagotta

The Threefold Lore is mine, and I excel\
In Jhāna-ecstasy, adept in calm\
Of balanced mind. Salvation have I won,\
And all the Buddha-ordinance is done.


## 1.113 Vanavaccha (2)

Crags where clear waters lie, a rocky world,\
Haunted by black-faced apes and timid deer,\
Where 'neath bright blossoms run the silver streams:\
Those are the highlands of my heart's delight.


## 1.114 Adhimutta

If ye to this gross body give such heed,\
Greedy its pleasures to enjoy, the while\
Life's energies do ebb away, O whence\
Shall come perfection in the holy life?


## 1.115 Mahanāma

Lo thou! how to a wretched end art come\
By this steep crag, this famous Hunter's Hill,\
Its many crests begirt by sāl-tree woods,\
 clothed!


## 1.116 Pāpāpariya

Avoiding truck with contact's sixfold field,\
Guarding the gates of sense, master of self,\
The general root of misery vomiting,\
From every poison-taint am I immune.


## 1.117 Yasa

With perfumed skin and delicately clad\
And head ablaze with gems, natheless my way\
I found and made the Threefold Lore my own;\
And now the Buddha-ordinance is done.


## 1.118 Kimbila

As bidden by some power age o'er her falls.\
Her shape is as another, yet the same.\
Now this my self, who ne'er have left myself,\
Seems other than the self I recollect.


## 1.119 Vajji-putta (2)

Come thou and plunge in leafy lair of trees,\
Suffer Nibbāna in thy heart to sink!\
Study and dally not, thou Gotamid!\
What doth this fingle-fangle mean to thee?


## 1.120 Isidatta

The factors of my life well understood\
Stand yet a little while with severed root.\
Sorrow is slain! that quest I've won, and won\
Is purity from fourfold Venom's stain.
