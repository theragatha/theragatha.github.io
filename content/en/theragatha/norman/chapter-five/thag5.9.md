# 5.9 Vijitasena

I shall fasten you, mind,\
like an elephant at a small gate.\
I shall not incite you to evil,\
you net of sensual pleasure, body-born.

When fastened, you will not go,\
like an elephant not finding the gate open.\
Witch-mind, you will not wander again, and again, using force, delighting in evil.

As the strong hook-holder makes an untamed elephant,\
newly taken, turn against its will,\
so shall I make you turn.

As the excellent charioteer,\
skilled in the taming of excellent horses,\
tames a thoroughbred, so shall I,\
standing firm in the five powers, tame you.

I shall bind you with mindfulness;\
with purified self shall cleanse [you].\
Restrained by the yoke of energy you will not go far from here, mind.
