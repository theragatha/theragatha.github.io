# 1.56 Kuṭivihārin</a>

Who's in my little hut? A brother 'tis,\
Who in thy little hut, all passions tamed,\
Hath throughly set his mind. Know this, O friend,\
'Twas not for naught thou mad'st thy little hut!

Within the hut a brother dwells, peace in his heart, purged of all taint.\
Fruit of this deed shall be to thee: lord of the gods thou'll come to be\
Six times, ay, seven, lord of the gods, ruler over celestial realms,\
Thereafter all thy passions tamed, a Silent Buddha thou shalt be.
