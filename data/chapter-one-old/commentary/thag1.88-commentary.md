# Ajjuna

## Commentary

He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, in the family of a councillor, and named Ajjuna. When grown up he came into contact with the Jains, and entered their Order very young, thinking among them to win salvation. [^1] But finding there nothing to satisfy him, [^2] he met the Master, believed, entered his Order, and anon won arahant-ship. Then in rapture at his attainment, he burst forth in this verse:

## Verses

[88] 0 wonder that I found the power to draw\
Myself forth from the waters on dry land.\
Borne drifting on the awful flood I learnt\
To know the Truths, their truth to understand.
