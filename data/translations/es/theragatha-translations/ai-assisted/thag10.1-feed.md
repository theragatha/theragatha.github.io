Pali:

“Aṅgārino dāni dumā bhadante,
Phalesino chadanaṁ vippahāya;
Te accimantova pabhāsayanti,
Samayo mahāvīra bhāgī rasānaṁ.

Dumāni phullāni manoramāni,
Samantato sabbadisā pavanti;
Pattaṁ pahāya phalamāsasānā,
Kālo ito pakkamanāya vīra.

Nevātisītaṁ na panātiuṇhaṁ,
Sukhā utu addhaniyā bhadante;
Passantu taṁ sākiyā koḷiyā ca,
Pacchāmukhaṁ rohiniyaṁ tarantaṁ.

Āsāya kasate khettaṁ,
bījaṁ āsāya vappati;
Āsāya vāṇijā yanti,
samuddaṁ dhanahārakā;
Yāya āsāya tiṭṭhāmi,
sā me āsā samijjhatu.

Punappunaṁ ceva vapanti bījaṁ,
Punappunaṁ vassati devarājā;
Punappunaṁ khettaṁ kasanti kassakā,
Punappunaṁ dhaññamupeti raṭṭhaṁ.

Punappunaṁ yācanakā caranti,
Punappunaṁ dānapatī dadanti;
Punappunaṁ dānapatī daditvā,
Punappunaṁ saggamupenti ṭhānaṁ.

Vīro have sattayugaṁ puneti,
Yasmiṁ kule jāyati bhūripañño;
Maññāmahaṁ sakkati devadevo,
Tayā hi jāto muni saccanāmo.

Suddhodano nāma pitā mahesino,
Buddhassa mātā pana māyanāmā;
Yā bodhisattaṁ parihariya kucchinā,
Kāyassa bhedā tidivamhi modati.

Sā gotamī kālakatā ito cutā,
Dibbehi kāmehi samaṅgibhūtā;
Sā modati kāmaguṇehi pañcahi,
Parivāritā devagaṇehi tehi”.

“Buddhassa puttomhi asayhasāhino,
Aṅgīrasassappaṭimassa tādino;
Pitupitā mayhaṁ tuvaṁsi sakka,
Dhammena me gotama ayyakosī”ti.

Sujato:

“The trees are now crimson, venerable sir,
they’ve shed their foliage, and are ready to fruit.
They shine as if aflame;
great hero, this season is full of flavor.

The blossoming trees are delightful,
wafting their scent all around, in all directions.
They’ve shed their leaves and wish to fruit,
hero, it is time to leave here.

It is neither too hot nor too cold,
venerable sir, it’s a pleasant season for traveling.
Let the Sākiyans and Koliyans see you,
heading west across the Rohiṇī river.

In hope, the field is plowed;
the seed is sown in hope;
in hope, merchants travel the seas,
carrying rich cargoes.
The hope that I stand for:
may it succeed!

Again and again, they sow the seed;
again and again, the king of the heavens sends rain;
again and again, farmers plow the field;
again and again, grain is produced for the nation.

Again and again, the beggars wander,
again and again, the donors give.
Again and again, when the donors have given,
again and again, they take their place in heaven.

A hero of vast wisdom purifies seven generations
of the family in which they’re born.
Sakya, I believe you’re the king of kings,
since you fathered the one who is truly called a sage.

The father of the great seer is named Suddhodana;
and the Buddha’s mother is named Māyā.
Having borne the Bodhisatta in her belly,
she rejoices in the Third Heaven.

When she died and passed away from here,
she was blessed with heavenly sensual pleasures;
enjoying the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
Gotamī is surrounded by those hosts of gods.”

“I’m the son of the Buddha, the incomparable Aṅgīrasa, the unaffected,
the bearer of the unbearable.
You, Sakya, are my father’s father;
Gotama, you are my grandfather in the Dhamma.”

527. The trees are now crimson, lord, having shed their (old)
foliage, about to fruit. They illuminate as though aflame.
The time partakes of flavour, great hero.
528. The delightful trees, in bloom, diffuse their scent all
around in all directions, having shed their petals, hoping for
fruit. It is time to go forth from here, hero.
529. It is not too cold, nor again too hot; the season is pleasant,
fit for a journey, lord. Let the Säkiyas and Koliyas see you
facing west, crossing in the River Rohiņi.
530. The field is ploughed in hope; in hope the seed is sown;
in hope merchants go to sea, bringing back wealth. Let that
hope of mine, in which I stand, be realized.
531. Again and again they sow the seed; again and again the
deva-king rains; again and again farmers plough the field;
again and again grain comes to the kingdom.
532. Again and again beggars wander; again and again
master-givers give; again and again master-givers, having
given, go to the heavenly place.
533. A hero of great wisdom indeed cleanses seven generations
in whatever family he is born. I think, Sakiya, you are the
deva of devas, for you begot the sage who is truly named.
534. The father of the great seer is called Suddhodana, but the
Buddha's mother was called Māyā, who, having cherished
the Bodhisatta with her womb, after the breaking up of the
body rejoices in the three heavens.
535. She, Gotami, having died, having descended from here,
being possessed of deva-like sensual pleasures, rejoices in
five strands of sensual pleasures, surrounded by those groups
of devas.
536. I am the son of the Buddha, who endures what is beyond
endurance, the son of the incomparable venerable Angirasa.
You, Sakiya, are my father's father; truly you are my
grandfather, Gotama.

Davids:

[527] Now crimson glow the trees, dear Lord, and cast
Their ancient foliage in quest of fruit.[2]
Like crests of flame they shine irradiant,
And rich in hope, great Hero, is the hour.

[528] Verdure and blossom-time in every tree,
Where'er we look delightful to the eye,
And every quarter breathing fragrant airs,[3]
While petals falling, yearning comes for fruit: -
'Tis time, O Hero, that we set out hence.

[529] Not over hot, nor over cold, but sweet,
O Master, now the season of the year.
O let the Sakiyans and the Koḷiyans
Behold thee with thy face set toward the West,
Crossing the [border-river] Rohinī.[4]

[530] [250] In hope the field is ploughed, in hope the seed is sown,
In hope of winning wealth merchants fare over sea.
The hope I cherish, may that hope be realized!

[531] Again and yet again is seed in furrow sown.
Again and yet again the cloud-king sends down rain,
Again and yet again the ploughmen plough the field,
Again and yet again comes corn into the realm.

[532] Again and yet again do beggars go their round;
Again and yet again the generous donors give;
Again and yet again when many gifts are given,
Again and yet again the donors find their heaven.

[533] Surely a hero lifts to lustrous purity
Seven generations past wherever he be born.
And so methinks can He, the vastly wise, the god
Of gods. In Thee is born in very truth a Seer.

[534] Suddhodana is named the mighty prophet's sire,
And mother of the Buddha was [our queen] Māyā.
She, having borne the Wisdom being in her womb,
Found, when the body died, delight in Tusita.[5]

[535] She, Gotamid, dying on earth, deceasing hence,
Now lives in heavenly joys attended by those gods.

[536] Son of the Buddha I, yea, e'en of such as He,
Th' Angīrasa, to whom there lives not any peer,
[251] Who that which is insuperable hath o'ercome.
And father of my Father art thou, Sākiyan,
To me thou, Gotamid, art grandsire in the Norm.[6]
