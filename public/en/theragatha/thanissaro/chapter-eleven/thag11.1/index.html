As the monsoon wind
drives the clouds in the rainy season,

impel me.

Those rocky crags
refresh me.

isolated dwellings
frequented by predator &amp; prey,

“May these beings
be destroyed,
be slaughtered,
fall into pain.”
* * * The Teacher has been served by me;
the Awakened One’s bidding,
done;
the heavy load, laid down;
the guide to becoming,3 uprooted.
And the goal for which I went forth
from home life into homelessness
I’ve reached:
the end
of all fetters.
I don’t delight in death,
don’t delight in living.
I await my time
as a worker his wage.
I don’t delight in death,
don’t delight in living.
I await my time,
mindful, alert.

<p>Ven. Saṅkicca ordained as a novice at the age of seven, and is reported to have attained arahantship as his head was being shaved prior to his ordination. In the first of the following verses attributed to him, he engages himself in a rhetorical conversation while sitting in a rainy forest.</p>

<p>Ujjuhāna. The Commentary offers two interpretations for this word. The first is that it is a hill covered with jungle and many streams that tended to overflow in the rainy season. The other is that it is the name of a bird that could stay comfortable even when exposed to cold, wind, and rain. I’ve chosen the second alternative. K. R. Norman speculates that the term could be written ujjahāna, in which case it would be the present participle for a verb meaning “abandoned” or “cast off.” However, none of the manuscripts support his speculation.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
