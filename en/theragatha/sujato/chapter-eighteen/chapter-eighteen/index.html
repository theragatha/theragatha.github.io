Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,

mindful,<br>Relying on his psychic powers.</p><p>Returning from alms-round,<br>Kassapa ascends the mountain,<br>And practices jhāna without grasping,<br>With fear and dread abandoned.</p><p>Returning

tranquillity.</p><p>You won’t see yourself<br>By merely reciting words,<br>Wandering stiﬀ-necked<br>And thinking, “I’m better.”</p><p>The fool is no better,<br>But they think they are.<br>The wise don’t praise<br>Stiﬀ-minded people.</p><p>Whoever is not aﬀected<br>By the modes of conceit—<br>“I am better”, “I am not better”,<br>“I am worse”, or “I am the same”—</p><p>Poised, with such understanding,<br>Endowed with virtues,<br>And devoted to tranquillity of mind:<br>That is who the wise praise.</p><p>Whoever has no respect<br>For their companions in spiritual life<br>Is as far from true Dhamma<br>As the sky is from the earth.</p><p>Those whose conscience and shame<br>Are always rightly established,<br>Thrive in the spiritual life,<br>For them, there is no rebirth<br>In any state of existence.</p><p>If a monk who is haughty and fickle,<br>Wears rags from the rubbish-heap,<br>Like a monkey in a lion skin,<br>That doesn’t make him impressive.</p><p>But if they are humble and

powers,<br>All 10,000 of them,<br>Belong to the retinue of Brahmā.</p><p>They stand with hands in añjalī,<br>Honouring Sāriputta,<br>The general of the Dhamma, the hero,<br>The great meditator who is endowed with samādhi.</p><p>“Homage to you, thoroughbred among men!<br>Homage to you, best among men!<br>We do not even understand<br>The basis of your jhāna.</p><p>The profound domain of the Buddhas<br>Is truly amazing.<br>We do not understand them,<br>Though we’ve gathered here to split hairs.”</p><p>When he saw the company of gods<br>Paying homage to Sāriputta—<br>Who is truly worthy of homage—<br>Kappina smiled.</p><p>As far as this Buddha-field extends<br>I am outstanding in ascetic practices.<br>I have no equal,<br>Apart from the great sage himself.</p><p>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>The heavy burden is laid down,<br>I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn<br>In any state of existence.</p><p>Like a lotus flower unstained by water,<br>Gotama the immeasurable is unstained<br>By robes, lodgings, or food.<br>He inclines to renunciation,<br>And has escaped being reborn<br>In the three states of existence.</p><p>The great sage’s neck<br>Is the establishment of mindfulness;<br>Faith is his hands, and wisdom his head.<br>Having great knowledge,<br>He always wanders, quenched.</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a class=anchor
