4.1 Nāgasamāla# There’s a dancer along the highway,
Dancing as the music plays;
She’s adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,
With a garland of flowers
And perfume of sandalwood.
I entered for alms,
And while going along I glanced at her,
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,
Like a snare of death laid down.
Then the realization
Came upon me—
The danger became clear,
And I was firmly repulsed.

<p>There’s a dancer along the highway,<br>
Dancing as the music plays;<br>
She’s adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
With a garland of flowers<br>
And perfume of sandalwood.</p>
<p>I entered for alms,<br>
And while going along I glanced at her,<br>
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
Like a snare of death laid down.</p>
<p>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<h2 id="42-bhagu">4.2 Bhagu<a class="anchor" href="#42-bhagu">#</a></h2>
<p>Overwhelmed by drowsiness,<br>
I came out of my dwelling;<br>
Stepping up on to the walking meditation path,<br>
I fell to the ground right there.</p>
<p>I rubbed my limbs, and again<br>
I stepped up on to the walking meditation path.<br>
I walked meditation up and down the path,<br>
Serene inside myself.</p>
<p>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<h2 id="43-sabhiya">4.3 Sabhiya<a class="anchor" href="#43-sabhiya">#</a></h2>
<p>Others don’t understand<br>
That here we come to our end.<br>
Those that do understand this<br>
Settle their quarrels because of that.</p>
<p>And when those who don’t understand<br>
Behave as though they were immortal;<br>
Those who understand the Dhamma<br>
Are like the healthy among the sick.</p>
<p>Any lax act,<br>
Or corrupt religious observance,<br>
Or a spiritual life arousing suspicion,<br>
Does not yield great fruit.</p>
<p>Whoever has no respect<br>
For their companions in the spiritual life<br>
Is as far from true Dhamma<br>
As the sky is from the earth.</p>
<h2 id="44-nandaka">4.4 Nandaka<a class="anchor" href="#44-nandaka">#</a></h2>
<p>Damn these stinking bodies!<br>
They’re on Māra’s side, they ooze;<br>
And bodies have nine streams<br>
That are always flowing.</p>
<p>Don’t think much of bodies;<br>
Don’t disparage the Tathāgathas.<br>
They’re not even aroused by heaven,<br>
Let alone by humans.</p>
<p>But those dumb fools,<br>
With bad advisors, shrouded in delusion,<br>
That kind of person is aroused by bodies,<br>
When Māra has thrown the snare.</p>
<p>Those who have discarded<br>
Lust, hatred, and ignorance:<br>
They’ve cut the strings, they’re no longer bound—<br>
Such people are not aroused by bodies.</p>
<h2 id="45-jambuka">4.5 Jambuka<a class="anchor" href="#45-jambuka">#</a></h2>
<p>For fifty-five years<br>
I wore mud and dirt;<br>
Eating one meal a month,<br>
I tore out my hair and beard.</p>
<p>I stood on one foot;<br>
I rejected seats;<br>
I ate dried-out dung;<br>
I didn’t accept food that had been set aside for me.</p>
<p>Having done many actions of this kind,<br>
Which lead to a bad destination,<br>
As I was being swept away by the great flood,<br>
I went to the Buddha for refuge.</p>
<p>See the going for refuge!<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<h2 id="46-senaka">4.6 Senaka<a class="anchor" href="#46-senaka">#</a></h2>
<p>During the spring festival at Gayā,<br>
It was so welcome for me<br>
To see the Buddha,<br>
Teaching the supreme Dhamma.</p>
<p>He was glorious, the teacher of a community,<br>
Who had realised the highest, a leader,<br>
Conqueror of the world with its gods;<br>
His vision was unequalled.</p>
<p>A great being of power, a great hero,<br>
A great light, without defilements.<br>
With the utter ending of all defilements,<br>
The teacher has no fear from any direction.</p>
<p>For a long time, sadly, I was corrupted,<br>
Fettered by the bond of wrong view.<br>
That Blessed One, Senaka,<br>
Released me from all ties.</p>
<h2 id="47-sambhūta">4.7 Sambhūta<a class="anchor" href="#47-sambh%c5%abta">#</a></h2>
<p>Hurrying when it’s time for going slowly;<br>
Going slowly when it’s time to hurry;<br>
That fool falls into suffering<br>
Because of these muddled arrangements.</p>
<p>Their good fortune wastes away<br>
Like the moon in the waning fortnight;<br>
They become disgraced,<br>
And alienated from their friends.</p>
<p>Going slowly when it’s time for going slowly;<br>
Hurrying when it’s time to hurry;<br>
That wise person comes into happiness<br>
Because of these proper arrangements.</p>
<p>Their good fortune flourishes<br>
Like the moon in the waxing fortnight;<br>
They become famous and respected,<br>
Not alienated from their friends.</p>
<h2 id="48-rāhula">4.8 Rāhula<a class="anchor" href="#48-r%c4%81hula">#</a></h2>
<p>I am known as “Fortunate Rāhula”,<br>
Because I’m endowed in both ways:<br>
I am the son of the Buddha,<br>
And I have the vision of the Dhammas.</p>
<p>Since my defilements have ended,<br>
Since there is no more being reborn<br>
In any state of existence—<br>
I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,<br>
With the three knowledges<br>
And the vision of the deathless.</p>
<p>Blinded by sensual pleasures, trapped in a net,<br>
They are smothered over by craving,<br>
Bound by the Kinsman of the Negligent,<br>
Like a fish caught in a funnel-net trap.</p>
<p>Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,<br>
Having cut Māra’s bond,<br>
Having pulled out craving, roots and all:<br>
I’ve become cool, and realized nibbāna.</p>
<h2 id="49-candana">4.9 Candana<a class="anchor" href="#49-candana">#</a></h2>
<p>Covered with gold,<br>
Surrounded by all her maids,<br>
With my son upon her hip,<br>
My wife came up to me.</p>
<p>I saw her coming,<br>
The mother of my son,<br>
Adorned with jewellery and all dressed up,<br>
Like a snare of death laid down.</p>
<p>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<h2 id="411-dhammika">4.11 Dhammika<a class="anchor" href="#411-dhammika">#</a></h2>
<p>“Dhamma really protects you if you practice Dhamma;<br>
Dhamma well-practiced brings happiness.<br>
If you practice Dhamma, this is the benefit—<br>
You won’t go to a bad destination.</p>
<p>Dhamma and what is not Dhamma<br>
Don’t both lead to the same results.<br>
What is not Dhamma leads to hell,<br>
While Dhamma takes you to a good destination.</p>
<p>So you should be enthusiastic<br>
To perform acts of Dhamma,<br>
Rejoicing in the Fortunate One, the poised.<br>
Disciples of the best of Fortunate Ones<br>
Are firm in Dhamma;<br>
Those wise ones are led on,<br>
Going to the very best of refuges.”</p>
<p>“The boil has been burst from its root,<br>
The net of craving is undone.<br>
He has ended transmigration, he has nothing,<br>
Just like the full moon in a clear night sky.”</p>
<h2 id="412-sappaka">4.12 Sappaka<a class="anchor" href="#412-sappaka">#</a></h2>
<p>When the crane with its beautiful white wings,<br>
Startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,<br>
Flees, seeking shelter—<br>
Then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.</p>
<p>When the crane, so pure and white,<br>
Startled by fear of the dark thundercloud,<br>
Seeks for a cave to shelter in, but can’t see one—<br>
Then the River Ajakaraṇī delights me.</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t be delighted<br>
By the rose-apple trees<br>
That adorn both banks of the river there,<br>
Behind my cave?</p>
<p>Rid of snakes, that death-mad swarm,<br>
The lazy frogs croak:<br>
“Today isn’t the time to stray from mountain streams;<br>
Ajakaraṇī is safe, pleasant, and delightful.”</p>
<h2 id="413-mudita">4.13 Mudita<a class="anchor" href="#413-mudita">#</a></h2>
<p>I went forth to save my life;<br>
But I gained faith<br>
After receiving full ordination;<br>
And I strove, strong in effort.</p>
<p>With pleasure, let this body be broken!<br>
Let this lump of flesh be dissolved!<br>
Let both my legs fall off<br>
At the knees!</p>
<p>I won’t eat, I won’t drink,<br>
I won’t leave my dwelling,<br>
Nor will I lie down on my side,<br>
Until the dart of craving is drawn out.</p>
<p>As I dwell like this,<br>
See my energy and striving!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
