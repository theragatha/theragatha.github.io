bodies.</p><p>You sack of dung wrapped in skin!<br>You demon with horns on your chest!<br>Your body has nine streams,<br>Which are flowing all the time.</p><p>With its nine streams,<br>Your body stinks, full of dung.<br>A monk seeking purity would avoid it altogether,<br>Like excrement.</p><p>If they knew you<br>Like I do,<br>They’d keep far away,<br>Like a cesspit in the rainy-season.”</p><p>“So it is, great hero!<br>As you say, ascetic!<br>But some sink here<br>Like an old bull in mud.”</p><p>“Whoever might think<br>Of making the sky yellow,<br>Or any other colour,<br>Would only be causing trouble for themselves.</p><p>This mind is like the sky:<br>Serene inwardly.<br>Evil-minded one, don’t attack me<br>Like a moth to a bonfire.”</p><p>“See this fancy puppet,<br>A heap of sores, a composite body,<br>Diseased, obsessed over,<br>Having no lasting stability.</p><p>See this fancy shape,<br>With its gems and earrings;<br>It is bones wrapped with skin,<br>Made pretty by its clothes.</p><p>Rouged feet<br>And powdered face<br>Is enough to delude a fool,<br>But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>Hair in eight braids<br>And eyeliner applied,<br>Is enough to delude a fool,<br>But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>Like a newly decorated makeup box,<br>The disgusting body all adorned<br>Is enough to delude a fool,<br>But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>The hunter laid his trap,<br>But the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;<br>Having eaten the bait we go,<br>Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.</p><p>The hunter’s trap is broken,<br>And the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;<br>Having eaten the bait we go,<br>Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.”</p><p>“Then there was terror!<br>Then they had goose-bumps!<br>When Sāriputta, endowed with many qualities,<br>Passed into nibbāna.</p><p>All conditions are impermanent,<br>Their nature is to rise and fall.<br>They arise, then they cease—<br>And their stilling is bliss.”</p><p>“Those who see the five aggregates<br>As other, not as self,<br>Penetrate a subtle thing,<br>Like a hair-tip with an arrow.</p><p>Those who see conditions<br>As other, not as self,<br>Pierce a fine thing,<br>Like a hair-tip with an arrow.”</p><p>“As if struck by a sword,<br>As if their head was on fire,<br>Mindful, a monk should go forth,<br>To abandon desire for sensual

sage in his secluded lodging,<br>The heir to the best of Buddhas,<br>Is honoured even by Brahmā.”</p><p>“Calm and quiet,<br>The sage in his secluded lodging,<br>The heir to the best of Buddhas:<br>Brahman, you should honor Kassapa!</p><p>Even if someone were to be born<br>A hundred times repeatedly in the human realm,<br>And always as a brahman,<br>A student who memorized the Vedas,</p><p>And if he were a teacher,<br>With mastery of the three Vedas:<br>Honoring such a person<br>Isn’t worth a sixteenth of that.</p><p>Whoever attains the eight emancipations<br>Forwards and backwards before breakfast,<br>And then goes on alms-round—</p><p>Don’t attack such a monk!<br>Don’t ruin yourself, brahman!<br>Have faith in the arahant<br>Quickly venerate him with hands in añjalī,<br>Don’t let your head be split open!”</p><p>“If you think transmigration is the important thing,<br>You don’t see the Dhamma.<br>You’re following a twisted path,<br>A bad path that will lead you down.</p><p>Like a worm smeared with dung,<br>He is besotted with conditions.<br>Sunk in gain and honour,<br>Poṭṭhila goes on, hollow.”</p><p>“See Sāriputta coming!<br>It is good to see him.<br>Liberated in both ways,<br>Serene inside himself.</p><p>With dart removed and fetters ended,<br>With the three knowledges, destroyer of death,<br>Worthy of oﬀerings,<br>An unsurpassed field of merit for people.”</p><p>These famous gods<br>Endowed with psychic powers,<br>All 10,000 of them,<br>Are ministers of Brahmā.<br>They stand with hands in añjalī,<br>Honouring Moggallāna.</p><p>‘Homage to you, thoroughbred among men!<br>Homage to you, best of men!<br>Since your defilements are ended,<br>You, sir, are worthy of oﬀerings!’”</p><p>“Venerated by men and gods,<br>He has arisen, the transcender of death.<br>He is undefiled by conditions,<br>As a lotus-flower by water.</p><p>Knowing in an hour the thousand-fold world,<br>Including the Brahmā realm;<br>Having mastery of psychic powers,<br>And the knowledge<br>Of the passing away and rebirth of beings in time:<br>That monk sees the gods.”</p><p>“Sāriputta, the monk who has crossed over,<br>Would be supreme<br>Because of his wisdom,<br>Virtue, and peace.</p><p>But in a moment I can create the likenesses<br>Of ten million times 100,000 people!<br>I’m skilled in transformations;<br>I’m a master of physic powers.</p><p>A member of the Moggallāna clan,<br>Attained to perfection and mastery<br>In samādhi and knowledge,<br>Wise in the teachings of the unattached,<br>With serene faculties, has burst his bonds,<br>Like an elephant bursts a rope of creeper.</p><p>I’ve attended on the teacher<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>The heavy burden is laid down,<br>I’ve undone the attachment<br>To being reborn in any state of existence.</p><p>I’ve attained the goal<br>For the sake of which I went forth<br>From home life into homelessness—<br>The ending of all fetters.”</p><p>“‘What kind of hell was that,<br>Where Dussī was boiled,<br>After attacking the disciple Vidhura,<br>Along with the brahmin Kakusandha?’</p><p>‘There were 100 iron spikes,<br>Each one individually causing pain:<br>That was the kind of hell<br>Where Dussī was boiled,<br>After attacking the disciple Vidhura<br>Along with the brahmin Kakusandha.’</p><p>‘Dark One, if you attack<br>A monk who knows this from their own experience,<br>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>You will fall into suﬀering.</p><p>‘Mansions that last for an aeon<br>Stand in the middle of a lake;<br>The colour of lapis lazuli,<br>Brilliant, sparkling, and shining;<br>Many nymphs of diverse colours<br>Dance there.</p><p>‘Dark One, if you attack<br>A monk who knows this from their own experience,<br>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>You will fall into suﬀering.</p><p>‘The one who, encouraged by the Buddha,<br>With the monastic Saṅgha looking on,<br>Shook the palace of Migāra’s mother<br>With their big toe:</p><p>‘Dark One, if you attack<br>A monk who knows this from their own experience,<br>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>You will fall into suﬀering.</p><p>‘The one who shook Vejayanta palace<br>With their big toe,<br>Relying on psychic power,<br>Inspiring awe among the gods:</p><p>‘Dark One, if you attack<br>A monk who knows this from their own experience,<br>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>You will fall into suﬀering.</p><p>‘The one who asked Sakka in Vejayanta palace:<br>“Friend, do you know the freedom<br>That comes with the end of craving?”<br>And to whom, when asked this question,<br>Sakka answered truthfully:</p><p>‘Dark One, if you attack<br>A monk who knows this from their own experience,<br>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>You will fall into suﬀering.</p><p>‘The one who asked Brahmā<br>In the Sudhamma Hall before the assembly:<br>“Friend, do you still have the same view<br>That you had in the past?<br>Or do you see the radiance<br>Of the Brahmā world passing away?”</p><p>‘And to whom, when asked this question,<br>Brahmā answered truthfully:<br>“Friend, I don’t have that view<br>That I had in the past.</p><p>‘“I see the radiance<br>Of the Brahmā world passing away.<br>So how could I say today<br>That I am permanent and eternal?”</p><p>‘Dark One, if you attack<br>A monk who directly knows this,<br>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>You will fall into suﬀering.</p><p>‘The one who through emancipation has touched<br>The peak of the mighty Mount Neru,<br>The forests of Pubbavideha,<br>And the people who live there:</p><p>‘Dark One, if you attack<br>A monk who directly knows this,<br>A disciple of the Buddha,<br>You will fall into suﬀering.</p><p>‘Though a fire doesn’t think<br>“I’ll burn the fool”<br>Still the fool who comes too close<br>To the fire gets burnt.</p><p>‘In the same way Māra,<br>Having attacked the Tathāgata,<br>You’ll burn yourself,<br>Like a fool touching the flames.</p><p>‘Having attacked the Tathāgatha,<br>Māra produced demerit.<br>Wicked one, do you imagine:<br>“My wickedness won’t bear fruit?”</p><p>‘For a long time you’ve piled up<br>The wickedness that you’ve created.<br>Keep away from the Buddha, Māra!<br>Give up hope in tricking the monks.’</p><p>That is how, in the Bhesekaḷā grove<br>The monk rebuked Māra.<br>That spirit, downcast,<br>Disappeared right there!”</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a class=anchor href=#notes>#</a></h2><div
