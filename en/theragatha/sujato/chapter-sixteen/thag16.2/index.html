In seclusion, practicing jhāna,
An ascetic, the monk Pārāpariya
Had this thought:</p><p>“Following what system
What vow, what conduct,
May I do what I need to do for myself,
Without harming anyone else?</p><p>The faculties of human beings
Can lead to both welfare and harm.
Unguarded they lead to harm;
Guarded they lead to welfare.</p><p>By protecting the faculties,
Taking care of the faculties,
I can do what I need to do for myself
Without harming anyone else.</p><p>If your eye wanders
Among sights without check,
Not seeing the danger,
You’re not freed from suffering.</p><p>If your ear wanders
Among sounds without check,
Not seeing the danger,
You’re not freed from suffering.</p><p>If, not seeing the escape,
You indulge in smell,
You’re not freed from suffering,
Being infatuated by smells.</p><p>Recollecting the sour,
And the sweet and the bitter,
Captivated by craving for taste,
You don’t understand the heart.</p><p>Recollecting lovely
And pleasurable touches,
Full of desire, you experience
Many kinds of suffering because of lust.</p><p>Unable to protect
The mind from such mental phenomena,
Suffering follows them,
Because of all five.</p><p>This body is full of pus and blood,
As well as many carcasses;
But cunning people decorate it
Like a lovely painted casket.</p><p>You don’t understand that
The gratification of sweetness turns out bitter,
And attachments to those we love are suffering,
Like a razor smeared all over with honey.</p><p>Full of lust for the sight of a woman,
For the voice and the smells of a woman,
For a woman’s touch,
You experience many kinds of suffering.</p><p>All of a woman’s streams
Flow from five to five.
Whoever, being energetic,
Is able to curb these,</p><p>Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,
Would be clever and discerning;
Even while enjoying himself,
What he does is connected
With Dhamma and its purpose.</p><p>You should avoid a meaningless task
That is leading to decline.
Thinking, ‘This is not to be done’,
Is being diligent and discerning.</p><p>Whatever is meaningful,
A principled happiness,
Let one undertake and practice that:
This is the best happiness.</p><p>Coveting the possessions of others
By whatever means, whether high or low,
One kills, injures, and torments,
Violently plundering the possessions of others.</p><p>Just as a strong person when building
Knocks out a peg with a peg,
So the skilful person
Knocks out the faculties with the faculties.</p><p>Developing faith, energy, samādhi
Mindfulness, and wisdom;
Destroying the five with the five,
The perfected one lives without worry.</p><p>Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,
Having fulfilled in every respect
The instructions spoken by the Buddha,
That person prospers in happiness.”</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a class=anchor href=#notes>#</a></h2><div class=page-citation style=margin-top:.75rem;font-size:.95em;color:var(--muted)><div class=citation-text><em>Translation © Bhikkhu Sujato 2018, from <a href=https://suttacentral.net>SuttaCentral.net</a>, licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a>.</em></div></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div></div><div></div></div><div class=book-comments></div><script>(function(){document.querySelectorAll("pre:has(code)").forEach(e=>{e.addEventListener("click",e.focus),e.addEventListener("copy",function(t){if(t.preventDefault(),navigator.clipboard){const t=window.getSelection().toString()||e.textContent;navigator.clipboard.writeText(t)}})})})()</script></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#notes>Notes</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
