the ascetic practiced jhāna,<br>Seated in seclusion, unified,<br>In the forest full of flowers,<br>This thought came to him:</p><p>“The behaviour of the monks<br>These days seems different<br>From when the lord of the world,<br>The best of men, was still here.</p><p>Their robes were only for covering the private parts,<br>And protection from the cold and wind;<br>They ate in moderation,<br>Content with whatever they were offered.</p><p>Whether refined or rough,<br>Little or much,<br>They ate only for sustenance,<br>Without greed or gluttony.</p><p>They weren’t so very eager,<br>For the requisites of life,<br>Such as tonics and other necessities,<br>As they were for the end of defilements.</p><p>In the wilderness, at the foot of trees,<br>In caves and caverns,<br>Committed to seclusion,<br>They lived with that as their final goal.</p><p>They were used to simple things,<br>And were easy to look after,<br>Gentle, their hearts not stubborn,<br>Unsullied, not talkative,<br>Their minds were intent on the goal.</p><p>In this way they inspired confidence,<br>In their movements, eating, and practice;<br>Their deportment was smooth<br>As a stream of oil.</p><p>With the ending of all defilements,<br>Those senior monks have now realised nibbāna;<br>They were great meditators and great benefactors—<br>There are few like them today.</p><p>With the ending<br>Of good principles and understanding,<br>The conqueror’s teaching,<br>Full of all excellent qualities, has fallen apart.</p><p>This is the season<br>For bad principles and defilements.<br>Those who are ready for seclusion<br>Are all that’s left of the true Dhamma.</p><p>As they grow, the defilements<br>Possess many people;<br>They play with fools, I believe,<br>Like demons with the mad.</p><p>Overcome by defilements,<br>They run here and there<br>Among the causes for defilement,<br>As if they had declared war on themselves.</p><p>Having abandoned true Dhamma,<br>They argue with each other;<br>Following wrong views<br>They think, ‘This is better.’</p><p>They cut off their wealth,<br>Children, and wife to go forth;<br>But then they do what they shouldn’t,<br>For the sake of a measly spoon of alms-food.</p><p>They eat until their bellies are full,<br>And then they lie to sleep on their backs.<br>When they wake again, they keep on talking,<br>The kind of talk that the teacher criticized.</p><p>Valuing all the arts and crafts,<br>They train themselves in them;<br>Not being calm inside,<br>They think, ‘This is the purpose of the ascetic life’.</p><p>They provide clay, oil, and talcum powder,<br>Water, lodgings, and food<br>For householders,<br>Expecting more in return.</p><p>As well as tooth-picks, wood-apples,<br>Flowers, food to eat,<br>Well-cooked alms-food,<br>Mangoes and myrobalans.</p><p>In medicine they are like doctors,<br>In business like householders,<br>In decoration like prostitutes,<br>In sovereignty like lords.</p><p>Cheats, frauds,<br>False witnesses, sly:<br>Using multiple plans,<br>They enjoy material things.</p><p>Pursuing shams, contrivances, and plans,<br>By this means<br>They accumulate a lot of wealth<br>For the sake of their livelihood.</p><p>They assemble the community<br>For business rather than Dhamma.<br>They teach the Dhamma to others<br>For gain, not for the goal.</p><p>Those outside the Saṅgha<br>Quarrel over the Saṅgha’s property.<br>They’re shameless, and do not care<br>That they live on someone else’s property.</p><p>Some who have a shaven head<br>And wear the outer robe,<br>Are not devoted to practice,<br>But wish only to be honored,<br>Infatuated with property and reverence.</p><p>When things have come to this,<br>It’s not easy these days<br>To realise what has not yet been realised,<br>Or to preserve what has been realised.</p><p>A person with mindfulness established<br>Could walk without shoes<br>Even in a thorny place;<br>That is how a sage should walk in the village.</p><p>Remembering the meditators of old,<br>And recollecting their conduct;<br>Even in the latter days,<br>It is still possible to realise the deathless.”</p><p>That is what the ascetic, whose faculties<br>Were fully developed, said in the sāla tree grove.<br>The holy man, the sage, realised nibbāna:<br>Ending more rebirth into any state of existence.</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a
