A heap of sores, a composite body,
Diseased, obsessed over,
Having no lasting stability.</p><p>See this fancy shape,
With its gems and earrings;
It is bones wrapped with skin,
Made pretty by its clothes.</p><p>Rouged feet
And powdered face
Is enough to delude a fool,
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>Hair in eight braids
And eyeliner,
Is enough to delude a fool,
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>Like a newly decorated makeup box,
The disgusting body all adorned
Is enough to delude a fool,
But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>The hunter laid his trap,
But the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;
Having eaten the bait we go,
Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.</p><p>The hunter’s trap is broken,
And the deer didn’t get caught in the snare;
Having eaten the bait we go,
Leaving the deer-trapper to lament.</p><p>I see rich people in the world,
Who, because of delusion,
Don’t give away the wealth they have gained.
Greedily, they hoard their riches,
Yearning for ever more sensual pleasures.</p><p>A king who conquered the earth by force,
Ruling the land from sea to sea,
Unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,
Would still yearn for the further shore.</p><p>The king and most other people
Reach death while not free from craving.
As if lacking, they abandon the body;
For sensual pleasures offer
No satisfaction in this world.</p><p>Relatives lament, their hair let loose,
Saying “Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!”
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,
Heap up a pyre, and burn it.</p><p>It is poked with stakes while being burnt,
Wearing a single cloth, all wealth abandoned.
Neither kinsman nor friends nor companions
Can help you when you are dying.</p><p>Heirs take the riches,
But beings fare on in accord with their deeds.
Riches don’t follow you when you die;
Nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.</p><p>Longevity isn’t gained by riches,
Nor does wealth banish old age;
For the wise have said that this life is short,
It is not eternal, its nature is decay.</p><p>The rich and the poor feel its touch;
The fool and the wise feel it too;
But the fool lies as if struck down by their own folly,
While the wise don’t tremble at the touch.</p><p>Therefore wisdom is definitely better than wealth,
Since by wisdom
You can attain perfection in this life;
But if you stay unperfected,
Then because of delusion,
You’ll do evil deeds in life after life.</p><p>One person enters a womb and the world beyond,
Transmigrating from one life to the next;
While someone of little wisdom, placing faith in them,
Also enters a womb and the world beyond.</p><p>Just as a bandit caught at the entrance to a house
Is punished due to their own bad deeds;
So after passing away, in the world beyond
People are punished due to their own bad deeds.</p><p>Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful,
But their variety of forms stress the mind;
Seeing danger in the kinds of sensual pleasure,
I went forth, O King.</p><p>As fruit falls from a tree, so people fall,
Young and old, when the body breaks up.
Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;
Without doubt, the ascetic life is better.</p><p>Endowed with faith, I went forth,
Entering the conqueror’s teaching.
My going forth wasn’t wasted;
I eat food free of debt.</p><p>I saw sensual pleasures as burning,
Gold as a cutting blade,
Conception in a womb as suffering,
And the hells as very fearful.</p><p>Knowing this danger,
I was struck with awe.
I was stabbed, and then I became peaceful;
I’ve attained the end of defilements.</p><p>I’ve attended on the teacher
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
The heavy burden is laid down,
I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn
In any state of existence.</p><p>I’ve attained the goal
For the sake of which I went forth
From home life into homelessness—
The ending of all fetters.</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a class=anchor href=#notes>#</a></h2><div class=page-citation style=margin-top:.75rem;font-size:.95em;color:var(--muted)><div class=citation-text><em>Translation © Bhikkhu Sujato 2018, from <a href=https://suttacentral.net>SuttaCentral.net</a>, licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a>.</em></div></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div></div><div></div></div><div class=book-comments></div><script>(function(){document.querySelectorAll("pre:has(code)").forEach(e=>{e.addEventListener("click",e.focus),e.addEventListener("copy",function(t){if(t.preventDefault(),navigator.clipboard){const t=window.getSelection().toString()||e.textContent;navigator.clipboard.writeText(t)}})})})()</script></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#notes>Notes</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
