3.1 Aṅgaṇikabhāradvāja# Seeking purity the wrong way,
I worshipped the sacred fire in a grove.
Not knowing the path to purity,
I mortified my flesh in search of immortality.
I’ve gained this happiness by means of happiness:
See the excellence of the Dhamma!
I’ve attained the three knowledges,
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.
In the past I was related to Brahmā,
But now I’m really a brahmin:
I have the three knowledges, I’m cleansed,
I’m an initiate,
And I’m accomplished in sacred knowledge.

<p>Seeking purity the wrong way,<br>
I worshipped the sacred fire in a grove.<br>
Not knowing the path to purity,<br>
I mortified my flesh in search of immortality.<br>
I’ve gained this happiness by means of happiness:<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>
In the past I was related to Brahmā,<br>
But now I’m really a brahmin:<br>
I have the three knowledges, I’m cleansed,<br>
I’m an initiate,<br>
And I’m accomplished in sacred knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="32-paccaya">3.2 Paccaya<a class="anchor" href="#32-paccaya">#</a></h2>
<p>I went forth five days ago,<br>
A trainee, with my heart’s goal unfulfilled.<br>
I entered my dwelling,<br>
And an aspiration arose in my mind.<br>
I won’t eat; I won’t drink;<br>
I won’t leave my dwelling;<br>
Nor will I lie down on my side—<br>
Until the dart of craving is pulled out.<br>
See my energy and effort<br>
As I practice this way!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
<h2 id="33-bākula">3.3 Bākula<a class="anchor" href="#33-b%c4%81kula">#</a></h2>
<p>Whoever wishes to do afterwards<br>
What they should have done before<br>
They’ve lost the causes for happiness,<br>
And afterwards they’re tormented with remorse.<br>
You should only say what you would do;<br>
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.<br>
The wise will recognize<br>
One who talks without doing.<br>
Oh! nibbāna is so very blissful,<br>
As taught by the fully awakened Buddha:<br>
Sorrowless, stainless, secure;<br>
Where suffering all ceases.</p>
<h2 id="34-dhaniya">3.4 Dhaniya<a class="anchor" href="#34-dhaniya">#</a></h2>
<p>One who hopes for the ascetic life,<br>
Wishing to live in happiness,<br>
Should not look down on the Saṅgha’s robe,<br>
Or its food and drinks.<br>
One who hopes for the ascetic life,<br>
Wishing to live in happiness,<br>
Should stay in the Saṅgha’s lodgings,<br>
Like a snake in a mouse hole.<br>
One who hopes for the ascetic life,<br>
Wishing to live in happiness,<br>
Should be satisfied with whatever is offered,<br>
Developing this one quality.</p>
<h2 id="35-mātaṅgaputta">3.5 Mātaṅgaputta<a class="anchor" href="#35-m%c4%81ta%e1%b9%85gaputta">#</a></h2>
<p>“It’s too cold, too hot,<br>
Too late,” they say.<br>
Those who neglect their work like this—<br>
Opportunities pass them by.<br>
But one who considers hot and cold<br>
To be nothing more than a blade of grass;<br>
He does his manly duty,<br>
And his happiness never fails.<br>
With my chest I’ll thrust aside<br>
The grasses, vines, and creepers,<br>
And devote myself to seclusion.”</p>
<h2 id="36-khujjasobhita">3.6 Khujjasobhita<a class="anchor" href="#36-khujjasobhita">#</a></h2>
<p>“One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—<br>
Such brilliant speakers, and very learned—<br>
Stands at the door:<br>
The old man, Khujjasobhita.<br>
One of those monks who live in Pāṭaliputta—<br>
Such brilliant speakers, and very learned—<br>
Stands at the door:<br>
An old man, trembling in the wind.”<br>
“By war well fought, by sacrifice well made,<br>
By victory in battle;<br>
By living the spiritual life:<br>
That’s how this person flourishes in happiness.”</p>
<h2 id="37-vāraṇa">3.7 Vāraṇa<a class="anchor" href="#37-v%c4%81ra%e1%b9%87a">#</a></h2>
<p>Anyone among men<br>
Who harms other creatures:<br>
From this world and the next,<br>
That person will fall.<br>
But someone with a mind of loving-kindness,<br>
Compassionate for all creatures:<br>
That sort of person<br>
Gives rise to merit in abundance.<br>
One should train in good speech,<br>
In attending closely to ascetics,<br>
In sitting alone in hidden places,<br>
And in calming the mind.</p>
<h2 id="38-vassika">3.8 Vassika<a class="anchor" href="#38-vassika">#</a></h2>
<p>I was the only one in my family<br>
Who had faith and wisdom.<br>
It’s good for my relatives that I’m<br>
Firm in Dhamma, and my conduct is virtuous.<br>
I rebuked my family out of compassion,<br>
Reprimanding them because of my love<br>
For my family and relatives.<br>
They performed a service for the monks<br>
And then they passed away,<br>
To find happiness in the heaven of the Thirty-three.<br>
There, my brothers and mother rejoice<br>
With all the pleasures they desire.</p>
<h2 id="39-yasoja">3.9 Yasoja<a class="anchor" href="#39-yasoja">#</a></h2>
<p>“With knobbly knees,<br>
Thin, with veins matted on his skin,<br>
Eating and drinking in moderation—<br>
This person’s spirit is undaunted.”<br>
“Pestered by gadflies and mosquitoes<br>
In the awesome wilderness;<br>
One should mindfully endure,<br>
Like an elephant at the head of the battle.<br>
A monk alone is like Brahmā;<br>
A pair of monks are like devas;<br>
Three are like a village;<br>
And more than that is a rabble.”</p>
<h2 id="310-sāṭimattiya">3.10 Sāṭimattiya<a class="anchor" href="#310-s%c4%81%e1%b9%adimattiya">#</a></h2>
<p>In the past you had faith,<br>
Today you have none.<br>
What’s yours is yours alone;<br>
I’ve done nothing wrong.<br>
Faith is impermanent, fickle—<br>
So I have seen.<br>
People’s passions wax and wane:<br>
Why should a sage grow old worrying about that?<br>
The meal of a sage is cooked<br>
Bit by bit, in this family or that.<br>
I’ll walk for alms,<br>
For my legs are strong.</p>
<h2 id="311-upāli">3.11 Upāli<a class="anchor" href="#311-up%c4%81li">#</a></h2>
<p>One newly gone forth,<br>
Who has left their home out of faith,<br>
Should associate with spiritual friends,<br>
Whose livelihood is pure, and who are not lazy.<br>
One newly gone forth,<br>
Who has left their home out of faith,<br>
A monk who stays with the Saṅgha,<br>
Being wise, would train in monastic discipline.<br>
One newly gone forth,<br>
Who has left their home out of faith,<br>
Skilled in what is appropriate and what is not,<br>
Would wander undistracted.</p>
<h2 id="312-uttarapāla">3.12 Uttarapāla<a class="anchor" href="#312-uttarap%c4%81la">#</a></h2>
<p>Sadly, I was intelligent and peaceful,<br>
But only enough to critically analyse the meaning.<br>
The five kinds of sensual pleasure in the world,<br>
So delusory, were my downfall.<br>
Entering into Māra’s domain,<br>
I was struck by a powerful dart;<br>
But I was able to free myself<br>
From the trap laid by the king of death.<br>
All sensual pleasures have been abandoned,<br>
Rebirth in all states of existence is torn apart,<br>
Transmigration through births is finished,<br>
Now there is no more rebirth<br>
Into any state of existence.</p>
<h2 id="313-abhibhūta">3.13 Abhibhūta<a class="anchor" href="#313-abhibh%c5%abta">#</a></h2>
<p>All my family gathered here,<br>
Listen to me,<br>
I’ll teach you Dhamma!<br>
Being born again and again is suffering.<br>
Rouse yourselves, let go!<br>
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!<br>
Crush the army of death,<br>
Like an elephant crushes a hut of reeds.<br>
Whoever will live heedfully<br>
In this Dhamma and discipline,<br>
Will abandon transmigration through births,<br>
And make an end to suffering.</p>
<h2 id="314-gotama">3.14 Gotama<a class="anchor" href="#314-gotama">#</a></h2>
<p>Transmigrating, I went to hell;<br>
Again and again, I went to the ghost realm;<br>
Many times I dwelt long<br>
In the suffering of the animal realm.<br>
I was also reborn as a human;<br>
From time to time I went to heaven;<br>
I’ve stayed in the corporeal realms<br>
And the incorporeal,<br>
Among the percipient-nor-non-percipient,<br>
And the non-percipient.<br>
I understood these states of existence<br>
To be worthless:<br>
Conditioned, unstable, always in motion.<br>
When I understood the origin<br>
Of rebirth within myself,<br>
Mindful, I found peace.</p>
<h2 id="315-hārita">3.15 Hārita<a class="anchor" href="#315-h%c4%81rita">#</a></h2>
<p>Whoever wishes to do afterwards<br>
What they should have done before,<br>
They’ve lost the causes for happiness,<br>
And afterwards they’re tormented with remorse.<br>
You should only say what you would do;<br>
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.<br>
The wise will recognize<br>
One who talks without doing.<br>
Oh! nibbāna is so very blissful,<br>

Sorrowless, stainless, secure;<br>
Where suffering all ceases.</p>
<h2 id="316-vimala">3.16 Vimala<a class="anchor" href="#316-vimala">#</a></h2>
<p>Avoiding bad friends,<br>
You should associate with the best of people.<br>
Stick to the advice that he gave you,<br>
Aspiring for unshakable happiness.<br>
If someone lost in the middle of the ocean,<br>
Were to clamber up on a little log, they’d sink;<br>
In the same way, even a good person would sink<br>
If they rely on a lazy person.<br>
So avoid those who are lazy, lacking energy.<br>
Instead, dwell with the wise—<br>
Secluded, noble,<br>
