body,<br>Diseased, obsessed over,<br>Having no lasting stability.</p><p>See this fancy shape,<br>With its gems and earrings;<br>It is bones wrapped with skin,<br>Made pretty by its clothes.</p><p>Rouged feet<br>And powdered face<br>Is enough to delude a fool,<br>But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>Hair in eight braids<br>And eyeliner applied,<br>Is enough to delude a fool,<br>But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>Like a newly decorated make-up box,<br>The disgusting body all adorned<br>Is enough to delude a fool,<br>But not a seeker of the far shore.</p><p>Gotama is learned, a brilliant speaker,<br>The attendant to the Buddha.<br>Unfettered, with burden put aside,<br>He lies down to sleep.</p><p>Unfettered, his defilements have ended,<br>He has transcended attachments,<br>And has attained nibbāna.<br>He bears his final body,<br>Gone beyond birth and death.</p><p>Gotama, in whom the teachings of the Buddha,<br>The Kinsman of the Sun, are established,<br>Stands on the path<br>Leading to nibbāna.</p><p>I learned 82,000 from the Buddha,<br>And 2,000 from the monks;<br>These 84,000<br>Are the teachings I have memorized.</p><p>A person of

to me like<br>A blind man holding a lamp.</p><p>You should stay close to a learned person—<br>Don’t lose what you’ve learned.<br>It is the root of the spiritual life,<br>So you should memorize the Dhamma.</p><p>Knowing the sequence<br>And meaning of the teaching,<br>Skilled in the interpretation of terms,<br>He makes sure it is well memorized,<br>And then examines the meaning.</p><p>Accepting the teachings, he becomes enthusiastic;<br>Making an effort, he scrutinizes the Dhamma;<br>Striving at the right time,<br>He is serene inside himself.</p><p>If you want to understand the Dhamma,<br>You should associate with the sort of person<br>Who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,<br>A wise disciple of the Buddha.</p><p>A monk who is learned, and has memorized the Dhamma,<br>A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,<br>Is a visionary for the entire world,<br>Venerable, and learned.</p><p>Delighting in Dhamma, enjoying Dhamma,<br>Reflecting on Dhamma,<br>Recollecting Dhamma,<br>He doesn’t decline in the true Dhamma.</p><p>When your body is pampered and heavy,<br>While your remaining time is running out;<br>Greedy for physical pleasure,<br>How can you find happiness as an ascetic?</p><p>Every direction is unclear!<br>The Dhamma does not occur to me!<br>With the passing of our good friend,<br>It all seems dark.</p><p>If your friend has passed away,<br>And your teacher is past and gone,<br>There’s no friend like<br>Mindfulness of the body.</p><p>The old have passed away,<br>And I don’t get on with the new.<br>Today I meditate alone<br>Like a bird snug in its nest.”</p><p>“Many international visitors<br>Have come to see.<br>Don’t block the audience,<br>Let the congregation see me.”</p><p>“Lots of international visitors<br>Have come to see.<br>The teacher grants them the opportunity,<br>The seer doesn’t stop them.</p><p>For the 25 years<br>Since I have been a trainee,<br>No sensual perception arose in me:<br>See the excellence of the Dhamma!</p><p>For the 25 years<br>Since I have been a trainee,<br>No malicious perception arose in me:<br>See the excellence of the Dhamma!</p><p>For 25 years<br>I

left.</p><p>For 25 years<br>I attended on the Blessed One<br>With loving thoughts,<br>Like a shadow that never left.</p><p>While the Buddha was walking meditation,<br>I walked meditation behind him.<br>As he taught the Dhamma,<br>Knowledge arose in me.</p><p>I’m a trainee, who has more to do!<br>My mind is not perfected!<br>Yet the teacher, who was so compassionate to me,<br>Has passed into nibbāna.</p><p>Then there was terror!<br>Then they had goose-bumps!<br>When the Buddha, endowed with all qualities,<br>Passed into nibbāna.”</p><p>“Ānanda, who was learned,<br>And had memorized the Dhamma,<br>A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,<br>A visionary for the entire world,<br>Has passed into nibbāna.</p><p>He was learned, and had memorized the Dhamma,<br>A keeper of the great sage’s treasury,<br>A visionary for the entire world,<br>When all was black, he dispelled the dark.</p><p>He is the sage who remembered the teachings,<br>And mastered their sequence, holding them firm.<br>The senior monk who memorized the Dhamma,<br>Ānanda was a mine of gems.”</p><p>“I’ve attended on the teacher<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.<br>The heavy burden is laid down,<br>I’ve undone the attachment to being reborn<br>In any state of existence.”</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a class=anchor href=#notes>#</a></h2><div class=page-citation
