travel on the high-road,<br>Wrapped in robes of ivory color.</p><p>They’ll love white clothes,<br>And they’ll detest the deep-dyed ochre robe,<br>The banner of the arahants,<br>Which is worn without disgust by the free.</p><p>They’ll want lots of things,<br>And be lazy, lacking energy;<br>Weary of the forest,<br>They’ll stay in villages.</p><p>Being unrestrained, they’ll keep company

worthy of the ochre robe.</p><p>The conceited, arrogant fool,<br>Who has no virtue,<br>Is worthy of a white robe—<br>What use is an ochre robe for them?</p><p>In the future, monks and nuns<br>With corrupt hearts, disrespectful,<br>Will disparage those<br>With hearts of loving-kindness.</p><p>Though trained in wearing the robe<br>By senior monks,<br>The unintelligent will not listen,<br>Wild, doing what they like.</p><p>With that kind of attitude to training,<br>Those fools won’t respect each another,<br>Or take any notice of their mentors,<br>Like a wild horse with its charioteer.</p><p>So, in the future,<br>This will be the practice<br>Of monks and nuns,<br>When the latter days have come.</p><p>Before this terrifying future arrives,<br>Be easy to admonish,<br>Kind in speech,<br>And respect one another.</p><p>Have hearts of loving-kindness and compassion,<br>And keep your precepts;<br>Be energetic, resolute,<br>And always strong in exertion.</p><p>Seeing
