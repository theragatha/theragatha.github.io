profundity of the Dhamma,<br>They remain on the near shore.<br>Superficial and disrespectful towards the Dhamma,<br>They have no respect for one another.</p><p>In the future,<br>Many dangers will arise in the world.<br>Fools will defile<br>The Dhamma that has been taught so well.</p><p>Though lacking good qualities,<br>The incompetent, the talkative,<br>And the unlearned,<br>Will be powerful in Saṅgha proceedings.</p><p>Though possessing good qualities,<br>The competent, the conscientious,<br>And the unbiased,<br>Will be weak in Saṅgha proceedings.</p><p>In the future, fools will accept<br>Gold and silver,<br>Fields and property, goats and sheep,<br>And male and female bonded servants.</p><p>Fools looking to find fault in others,<br>But bereft of virtues themselves,<br>Will wander about, insolent,<br>Like cantankerous beasts.</p><p>They’ll be arrogant,<br>Wrapped in robes of blue;<br>Deceitful, obstinate, chatty, caustic,<br>They’ll wander as if they were noble ones.</p><p>With hair sleeked back with oil,<br>Fickle, their eyes painted with eye-liner,<br>They’ll travel on the high-road,<br>Wrapped in robes of ivory color.</p><p>They’ll love white clothes,<br>And they’ll detest the deep-dyed ochre robe,<br>The banner of the arahants,<br>Which is worn without disgust by the free.</p><p>They’ll want lots of things,<br>And be lazy, lacking energy;<br>Weary of the forest,<br>They’ll stay in villages.</p><p>Being unrestrained, they’ll keep company with<br>Those who obtain lots of things,<br>And who always enjoy wrong

the ochre robe;<br>The monks will not reflect<br>On the nature of the ochre robe.</p><p>This awful lack of reflection<br>Was unthinkable to the elephant,<br>Who was overcome by suffering,<br>Pierced by an arrow, and injured.</p><p>Then the six-tusked elephant,<br>Seeing the deep-coloured banner of the arahants,<br>Straight away spoke these verses<br>Connected with the goal.</p><p>The impure one<br>Who will wear the ochre robe<br>Without taming and truth,<br>Isn’t worthy of the ochre robe.</p><p>Whoever has rejected impurities,<br>Endowed with virtues,<br>Possessing truth and

ochre robe.</p><p>Whoever is endowed with virtue,<br>Free of lust, possessing samādhi,<br>Their heart’s intention pure,<br>They are truly worthy of the ochre robe.</p><p>The conceited, arrogant fool,<br>Who has no virtue,<br>Is worthy of a white robe—<br>What use is an ochre robe for them?</p><p>In the future, monks and nuns<br>With corrupt hearts, disrespectful,<br>Will disparage those<br>With hearts of loving-kindness.</p><p>Though trained in wearing the robe<br>By senior monks,<br>The unintelligent will not listen,<br>Wild, doing what they like.</p><p>With that kind of attitude to training,<br>Those fools won’t respect each another,<br>Or take any notice of their mentors,<br>Like a wild horse with its charioteer.</p><p>So, in the future,<br>This will be the
