5.1 Rājadatta# I, a monk, went to a charnel ground
And saw a woman left there,
Discarded in a cemetery,
Full of worms that devoured her.
Some men were disgusted,
Seeing her dead and rotten;
But sexual desire arose in me,
I was as if blind to her oozing body.
Quicker than the boiling of rice
I left that place,
Mindful and aware,
I sat down to one side.

<p>I, a monk, went to a charnel ground<br>
And saw a woman left there,<br>
Discarded in a cemetery,<br>
Full of worms that devoured her.</p>
<p>Some men were disgusted,<br>
Seeing her dead and rotten;<br>
But sexual desire arose in me,<br>
I was as if blind to her oozing body.</p>
<p>Quicker than the boiling of rice<br>
I left that place,<br>
Mindful and aware,<br>
I sat down to one side.</p>
<p>Then the realization<br>
Came upon me—<br>
The danger became clear,<br>
And I was firmly repulsed.</p>
<p>Then my mind was liberated—<br>
See the excellence of the Dhamma!<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>

<p>If a person, wishing for a certain outcome,<br>
Applies themselves to a misguided endeavor,<br>
And they don’t achieve what they have practiced for,<br>
They say: “That’s a sign of my bad luck.”</p>
<p>When a misfortune<br>
Has been plucked out and conquered,<br>
To give it up in part would be like<br>
The losing throw of the dice;<br>
But to give up everything<br>
Would be as if one was blind,<br>
Not discerning the even and the uneven.</p>
<p>You should only say what you would do;<br>
You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.<br>
The wise will recognize<br>
One who talks without doing.</p>
<p>Just like a glorious flower<br>
That’s colourful but lacks fragrance;<br>
So is well-spoken speech fruitless<br>
For one not acting in accordance.</p>

<p>My mentor helped me to learn,<br>
Hoping that I would practice those teachings;<br>
Aspiring for the deathless,<br>
I’ve done what was to be done.</p>
<p>I’ve arrived at the Dhamma,<br>
And witnessed it for myself, not based on hearsay.<br>
With purified knowledge, free of doubt,<br>
I declare it in your presence.</p>
<p>I know my past life;<br>
My clairvoyance is clarified;<br>
I’ve realized my own true goal,<br>
The Buddha’s instruction is fulfilled.</p>
<p>Being heedful in the training,<br>
I have learned your teachings well.<br>
All my defilements are ended;<br>
Now there is no more rebirth<br>
Into any state of existence.</p>
<p>You advised me in noble ways;<br>
Compassionate, you helped teach me;<br>
Your instruction was not in vain—<br>
I, your student, am fully trained.</p>

<p>It was good, how my mother<br>
Spurred me onwards.<br>
When I heard her words,<br>
Advised by my mother,<br>
I became energetic, resolute—<br>
I realised supreme awakening.</p>
<p>I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,<br>
With the three knowledges<br>
And the vision of the deathless;<br>
I conquered Namuci’s army,<br>
And now I live without defilements.</p>
<p>The defilements which I had,<br>
Both internally and externally,<br>
Are now all cut off without remainder;<br>
They won’t arise again.</p>
<p>My skilful sister<br>
Said this to me:<br>
“Now neither you nor I<br>
Have any entanglements.”</p>
<p>Suffering is at an end;<br>
This is the last body<br>
To transmigrate through birth and death:<br>
Now there is no more rebirth<br>
Into any state of existence.</p>

<p>It was truly for my benefit<br>
That the Buddha went to the river Nerañjara;<br>
When I heard his teaching,<br>
I rejected wrong view.</p>
<p>Previously, I performed the higher<br>
And lower sacrifices;<br>
I worshipped the sacred flame,<br>
Thinking, “This is purity.”<br>
I was a blind, unenlightened person.</p>
<p>Caught in the thicket of wrong view,<br>
Deluded by misapprehension;<br>
Thinking impurity was purity,<br>
I was blind and ignorant.</p>
<p>I’ve abandoned wrong view,<br>
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,<br>
I worship what is truly worthy of offerings:<br>
I bow to the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>I’ve abandoned all delusion,<br>
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,<br>
Transmigration through births is finished,<br>
Now there is no more rebirth<br>
Into any state of existence.</p>

<p>Three times a day—<br>
Morning, midday, and evening—<br>
I went down into the water at Gayā,<br>
For the Gayā spring festival.</p>
<p>“Whatever bad things I’ve done<br>
In previous births,<br>
I’ll now wash away right here”—<br>
This is the view I previously held.</p>
<p>Having heard the well-spoken words<br>
Regarding the Dhamma and the goal,<br>
I wisely reflected<br>
On the true, essential goal.</p>
<p>I’ve washed away all bad things;<br>
I’m stainless, cleansed, pristine;<br>
The pure heir of the pure one,<br>
A rightful son of the Buddha.</p>
<p>When I plunged into the eight-fold stream,<br>
All bad things were washed away.<br>
I’ve attained the three knowledges,<br>
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>

<p>“Struck by a wind ailment,<br>
While staying in a forest grove;<br>
You’ve gone into a tough place for gathering alms:<br>
How will you get by, monk?”</p>
<p>“Pervading my body<br>
With lots of rapture and happiness,<br>
Putting up with what’s tough,<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>
<p>Developing the establishments of mindfulness,<br>
The faculties and the powers,<br>
Developing the factors of awakening,<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>
<p>Having seen those who are energetic, resolute,<br>
Always of strong effort,<br>
Harmonious and serene,<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>
<p>Recollecting the Buddha,<br>
The highest, the tamed, who has samādhi;<br>
Not lazy by day or by night,<br>
I’ll dwell in the forest.”</p>
<h2 id="59-vijitasena">5.9 Vijitasena<a class="anchor" href="#59-vijitasena">#</a></h2>
<p>I’ll cage you, mind,<br>
Like an elephant in a stockade.<br>
Born of the flesh, that net of sensual pleasures,<br>
I won’t urge you to do bad.</p>
<p>Caged, you won’t escape,<br>
Like an elephant who can’t find an open gate.<br>
Demon-mind, you won’t wander again and again,<br>
Bullying, and loving to do bad.</p>
<p>Just as a strong trainer with a hook,<br>
Takes a wild, newly captured elephant<br>
And wins it over against its will,<br>
So I’ll win you over.</p>
<p>Just as a fine charioteer,<br>
Skilled in the taming of fine horses,<br>
Tames a thoroughbred,<br>
So, firmly established in the five powers,<br>
I’ll tame you.</p>
<p>I’ll bind you with mindfulness,<br>
I’m committed to taming you;<br>
Restrained by harnessed energy,<br>
Mind, you won’t go far from here.</p>

<p>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They’re as far from true Dhamma,<br>
As the earth is from the sky.</p>
<p>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They decline in the true Dhamma,<br>
Like the moon in the waning fortnight.</p>
<p>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They wither away in the true Dhamma,<br>
Like a fish in too little water.</p>
<p>With fault-finding mind, the dullard<br>
Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.<br>
They don’t thrive in the true Dhamma,<br>
Like a rotten seed in a field.</p>
<p>But one with contented mind<br>
Who listens to the conqueror’s teachings—<br>
Having ended all defilements,<br>
Having witnessed the unshakable,<br>
Having arrived at the highest peace—<br>
They realize nibbāna without defilements.</p>

<p>I’ve received full ordination,<br>
I am liberated, without defilements,<br>
I’ve seen the Blessed One myself,<br>
And even stayed together with him.</p>
<p>The Blessed One, the teacher,<br>
Spent much of the night in the open;<br>
Then he, who is so skilled at dwelling in meditation,<br>
Entered his dwelling.</p>
<p>Spreading out his outer robe,<br>
Gotama made his bed;<br>
Like a lion in a rocky cave,<br>
With fear and dread abandoned.</p>
<p>Then, with lovely enunciation,<br>
Soṇa, a disciple of the Buddha,<br>
Recited the true Dhamma<br>
In the presence of the best of Buddhas.</p>
<p>When he has fully understood the five aggregates,<br>
Developed the straight path,<br>
And arrived at the highest peace,<br>
He will realize nibbāna without defilements.</p>

<p>Whatever wise person,<br>
Understanding their teacher’s words,<br>
Stays with them, their affection growing;<br>
That wise person is indeed devoted—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
<p>When extreme stresses arise,<br>
Whoever does not tremble, but reflects instead,<br>
That wise person is indeed strong—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
<p>Steady as the ocean, imperturbable,<br>
Their wisdom is deep, and they see the subtle goal;<br>
That wise person is indeed immovable—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
<p>They’re very learned, and have memorized the Dhamma,<br>
Practising Dhamma in accordance with Dhamma;<br>
That wise person is indeed such—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
<p>They know the meaning of what is said,<br>
And having known, they act appropriately;<br>
That wise person is indeed<br>
One who has mastered the meaning—<br>
Knowing about Dhammas, they’re distinguished.</p>
