than that,<br>They won’t scare me:<br>I stand firm in Dhamma.</p><p>Only once did I personally hear<br>From the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,<br>About the path leading to nibbāna;<br>My mind was delighted with that teaching.</p><p>Wicked one, if you come near me<br>As I live like this,<br>I’ll act in such a way that you, Death,<br>Will not even see the path I travel.</p><p>Entirely abandoning likes and dislikes,<br>Along with thoughts attached to the household life,<br>He wouldn’t get entangled in anything,<br>He is a monk without entanglements.</p><p>On this earth and in the sky,<br>Whatever form you take when entering the world<br>Wears out, it is all impermanent;<br>Reflective people live understanding this.</p><p>People are bound in their attachments<br>To what is seen, heard, and thought.<br>Being imperturbable, expel desire for these things;<br>For one they call a sage does not cling to these things.</p><p>Attached to sixty kinds of wrong views<br>With their modes of thought,<br>Unenlightened people are fixed in wrong principles;<br>But that monk wouldn’t go to any sectarian group,<br>Still less would he take up corrupt ways.</p><p>Clever, and for a long time established in samādhi,<br>Free of deceit, disciplined, without envy,<br>The sage has realised the state of peace,<br>Since he has realized nibbāna, he awaits his time.</p><p>Abandon conceit, Gotama!<br>Completely abandon the path to conceit;<br>Infatuated with the path to conceit,<br>You’ve had regrets for a long time.</p><p>Smeared by smears and slain by conceit,<br>People fall into hell.<br>When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell,<br>They grieve for a long time.</p><p>But a monk never grieves<br>If they practice rightly, a victor of the path.<br>They have renown and happiness,<br>And they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Dhamma’.</p><p>So don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic,<br>With hindrances abandoned, purified,<br>And with conceit abandoned completely,<br>Be at peace, and use knowledge to make an end.”</p><p>“I’ve got a burning desire for pleasure;<br>My mind is on fire!<br>Please, out of compassion, Gotama,<br>Tell me how to quench the flames.”</p><p>“Your mind is on fire<br>Because of a perversion of perception.<br>Avoid noticing the attractive aspect of things<br>That provokes lust.</p><p>Meditate on the unattractive,<br>Unified, in samādhi;<br>With mindfulness immersed in the body,<br>Make much of disenchantment.</p><p>Meditate on the signless,<br>Throw out the underlying tendency to conceit,<br>And when you have a breakthrough<br>In understanding conceit,<br>You will live at peace.”</p><p>“Speak only such words<br>As do not hurt yourself<br>Nor harm others.<br>Such speech is truly well spoken.</p><p>Speak only pleasing words,<br>Words received gladly;<br>Pleasing words are those<br>That don’t have bad eﬀects on others.</p><p>Truth itself is the undying word:<br>This is an eternal principle.<br>Realists say that the Dhamma and its meaning<br>Are grounded in the truth.</p><p>The reliable words spoken by the Buddha<br>For realizing nibbāna,<br>And making an end of suﬀering:<br>This really is the best kind of speech.”</p><p>“His understanding is profound, he is wise,<br>He is skilled in knowing the path<br>And what is not the path;<br>Sāriputta, of great understanding,<br>Teaches Dhamma to the monks.</p><p>He teaches in brief,<br>Or he speaks at length,<br>His voice, which sounds like a myna bird,<br>Inspires intuition.</p><p>While he teaches,<br>The monks hear his sweet voice,<br>Sounding attractive,<br>Clear and mellifluous;<br>They listen joyfully<br>With hearts uplifted.”</p><p>“Today, on the fifteenth day uposatha,<br>500 monks have gathered together<br>To purify their precepts.<br>These sages without aﬄiction<br>Have cut oﬀ their fetters and bonds,<br>They will not be reborn again<br>Into any state of existence.</p><p>Just as a wheel-rolling emperor<br>Surrounded by ministers<br>Travels all around this<br>Land that is circled by sea;</p><p>So disciples with the three knowledges,<br>Destroyers of death,<br>Attend upon the winner of the battle,<br>The unsurpassed caravan leader.</p><p>All are sons of the Blessed One—<br>There is no rubbish here.<br>I bow to the Kinsman of the Sun,<br>The destroyer of the dart of craving.</p><p>Over a thousand monks<br>Attend on the Fortunate One<br>As he teaches the immaculate Dhamma:<br>Nibbāna, free of fear from any direction.</p><p>They hear the stainless Dhamma<br>Taught by the Buddha.<br>The Buddha is so brilliant,<br>Revered by the monastic Saṅgha.</p><p>Blessed One, you are called ‘elephant’,<br>Supreme among all sages.<br>You are like a great cloud<br>That rains on your disciples.</p><p>Setting out from his daytime dwelling<br>Wanting to see the teacher;<br>Great hero, your disciple,<br>Vaṅgisa bows at your feet.”</p><p>“Overcoming Māra’s devious path,<br>I wander with hard-heartedness dissolved.<br>See him, the liberator from bonds,<br>Unattached,<br>Teaching the Dhamma by analysing each section.</p><p>He has explained in many ways<br>The path to cross the flood.<br>Since the deathless has been explained,<br>The seers of Dhamma stand unshakable.</p><p>Like a piercing light,<br>He’s seen the transcendence of all states of rebirth;<br>Knowing it and witnessing it,<br>He taught it first to the group of five.</p><p>When Dhamma is well taught like this,<br>How could those who understand Dhamma<br>Be heedless?<br>Therefore you should train in the teaching<br>Of the Blessed One,<br>Heedful, and always reverent.”</p><p>“The senior monk who was awakened<br>After the Buddha<br>Koṇḍañña is keenly energetic,<br>And regularly gains the meditative states<br>Of happiness and seclusion.</p><p>Whatever can be realised<br>By a disciple following the teacher,<br>He has attained it all,<br>Diligent in training himself.</p><p>With great power and the three knowledges,<br>Skilled in reading the minds of others,<br>Koṇḍañña, the heir to the Buddha,<br>Bows at the teacher’s feet.”</p><p>“As the sage, who has gone beyond suﬀering,<br>Sits on the mountainside,<br>He is attended by disciples<br>With the three knowledges,<br>Destroyers of death.</p><p>Moggallāna, of great psychic power,<br>Searches with his mind,<br>Looking into their minds<br>For one liberated without attachments.</p><p>So they attend upon Gotama,<br>The sage gone beyond suﬀering,<br>Who is endowed with all attributes,<br>And with a multitude of qualities.”</p><p>“Just as, when the clouds have vanished,<br>The moon shines in the sky, stainless as the sun,<br>So Aṅgīrasa, great sage,<br>Your renown outshines the entire world.”</p><p>“We used to wander, drunk on poetry,<br>From village to village, from town to town;<br>Then we saw the Buddha,<br>Who has gone beyond all Dhammas.</p><p>He, the sage gone beyond suﬀering,<br>Taught me the Dhamma;<br>When we heard the Dhamma, we became confident—<br>Faith arose in us.</p><p>Hearing him speak of<br>The aggregates, the sense-bases,<br>And the elements, I understood.<br>I went forth into homelessness.</p><p>Truly, Tathāgatas arise<br>For the benefit of the many<br>Men and women<br>Who follow their teachings.</p><p>Truly, it is for their benefit<br>That the sage indeed realised awakening;<br>The monks and nuns, who see<br>The natural principles of the Dhamma.</p><p>The seer, the Buddha,<br>The Kinsman of the Sun,<br>Has well taught the four noble truths<br>Out of compassion for living beings.</p><p>Suﬀering, the origin of suﬀering,<br>The transcending of suﬀering,<br>And the noble eight-fold path<br>That leads to the stilling of suﬀering.</p><p>As these things were spoken,<br>So I have seen them.<br>I’ve realized my own true goal,<br>The Buddha’s instruction is completed.</p><p>It was so welcome for me,<br>As I was in the presence of the Buddha.<br>Of things which are shared,<br>I encountered the best.</p><p>I’ve realised the perfection of direct knowledge;<br>I have supernormal hearing;<br>I have the three knowledges and psychic powers,<br>I’m skilled at reading the minds of others.”</p><p>“I ask the teacher unrivalled in understanding,<br>Who has cut oﬀ all doubts in this very life—<br>Has a monk died at Aggāḷava, who was<br>Well-known, famous, and attained to nibbāna?</p><p>Nigrodhakappa was his name;<br>It was given to that brahman by you, Blessed One.<br>Yearning for freedom, energetic,<br>Firmly seeing the Dhamma,<br>He wandered in your honor.</p><p>O Sakyan, who sees all around,<br>All of us wish to know about that disciple.<br>Our ears are eager to hear,<br>For you’re truly the most excellent teacher.</p><p>Cut oﬀ our doubt, declare this to us;<br>Your understanding is vast, tell us of his nibbāna!<br>You see all around, so speak among us,<br>Like the thousand-eyed Sakka<br>In the assembly of the gods!</p><p>Whatever ties there are, or paths to delusion,<br>Or things that are on the side of unknowing,<br>Or that are bases of doubt:<br>When it comes to the Tathāgata there are none;<br>Among people, his eye is the best.</p><p>For if no man were ever to disperse defilements,<br>Like the wind dispersing a mass of clouds,<br>Darkness would cover the whole world,<br>And even a lamp would not shine.</p><p>The wise are makers of light;<br>My hero, that is what I think of you.<br>We’ve come to you for your insight and knowledge:<br>Here in this assembly, declare to us about Kappāyana.</p><p>Swiftly send forth your sweet voice,<br>Like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking,<br>The sound is smooth, with a lovely tone:<br>Alert, we are all listening to you.</p><p>You have entirely abandoned birth and death;<br>Restrained and pure, speak the Dhamma!<br>Unenlightened people can’t fulfil all their wishes,<br>But Tathāgatas can achieve what they intend.</p><p>Your answer is definitive, and we will accept it,<br>For you have perfect understanding.<br>We raise our hands in añjalī one last time,<br>Your understanding is unrivalled,<br>So do not knowingly confuse us.</p><p>Knowing the noble Dhamma from top to bottom,<br>Your energy is unrivalled,<br>So do not knowingly confuse us.<br>Like a man in the baking summer sun<br>Would long for water,<br>I long for the rain of your voice to fall on my ears.</p><p>Surely Kappāyana<br>Did not live the spiritual life in vain?<br>Did he realise nibbāna,<br>Or did he still have a remnant of defilement?<br>Let us hear what kind of liberation he had!”</p><p>“He cut oﬀ craving for mind and body<br>In this very life,<br>The river of darkness that had long lain within him.<br>He has entirely crossed over birth and death.”<br>So declared the Blessed One, the leader of the five.</p><p>“Now that I have heard your words,<br>Best of sages, I am confident.<br>My question, it seems, was not in vain,<br>The brahman did not deceive me.</p><p>As he spoke, so he acted;<br>He was a disciple of the Buddha.<br>He cut the net of death the illusionist,<br>So extended and strong.</p><p>Blessed One, Kappāyana saw<br>The starting point of grasping.<br>He has gone beyond the realm of death,<br>So very hard to cross.</p><p>God of gods, best of men, I bow to you;<br>And to your son,<br>Who follows your example, a great hero<br>An elephant, true son of an elephant.”</p><div class=page-citation style=margin-top:.75rem;font-size:.95em;color:var(--muted)><div class=citation-text><em>Translation © Bhikkhu Sujato 2018, from <a
