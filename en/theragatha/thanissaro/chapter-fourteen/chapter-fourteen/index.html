from home into homelessness,
I haven’t known
an ignoble, aversive resolve.
“May these beings
be destroyed,
be slaughtered,
fall into pain”—
I’ve not known this resolve
in this long, long time.
But I have known goodwill,
unlimited,
fully developed,
nurtured step after step,
as taught by the One
Awake:
to all, a friend;
to all, a comrade;
for all beings, sympathetic.
And I develop a mind of goodwill,
delighting in non-malevolence
—always.
Unvanquished, unshaken,
I gladden the mind.
I develop the sublime abiding,
not frequented by
the lowly.
Attaining no-thinking,
the disciple of the Rightly
Self-awakened One
is endowed with noble silence
straightaway.
As a mountain of rock
is unmoving,
firmly established,
so a monk,
with the ending of delusion,
like a mountain,
doesn’t quake.
To a person without blemish,
in constant quest of what’s pure,
a hair-tip of evil
seems a storm cloud.
As a frontier fortress is guarded
within & without,
you should safeguard yourselves.
Don’t let the moment
pass you by.
I don’t delight in death,
don’t delight in living.
I await my time
like a worker his wage.
I don’t delight in death,
don’t delight in living.
I await my time,
mindful, alert.
The Teacher has been served by me;
the Awakened One’s bidding,
done;
the heavy load, laid down;
the guide to becoming, uprooted.
And the goal for which I went forth
from home life into homelessness
I’ve reached:
the end
of all fetters.
Attain consummation
through heedfulness:
That is my message.
So then, I’m about to
unbind.
I’m released
everywhere.
