that in this world is well-mastered,
for virtue, when cultivated,
brings every consummation near.
Wise, one should protect one’s virtue,
aspiring to three pleasures:
praise, the gaining of wealth,
and—after death—rejoicing in heaven.
The virtuous one, through restraint,
acquires many friends,
while the unvirtuous one, practicing evil,
from friends is estranged.
The unvirtuous person gains
disrepute & dishonor;
the virtuous person, always,
repute, honor, & praise.
Virtue is the beginning, the establishing,
the mother of what is fine,
the foremost of all qualities:
Therefore virtue should be purified.
Virtue is also control, restraint,
the delight of the mind,
the ford of all Buddhas:
Therefore virtue should be purified.
Virtue: an incomparable strength.
Virtue: the ultimate weapon.
Virtue: the highest adornment.
Virtue: an astounding coat of mail.
Virtue: an imposing bridge.
Virtue: an unexcelled fragrance.
Virtue: the highest fragrant ointment
by which one wafts
this direction & that.
Virtue: the supreme provision.
Virtue: the ultimate food for the journey.
Virtue: the highest vehicle
by which one goes
this direction & that.
Right here he gains blame,
and after death, in deprivation,
he’s unhappy at heart:
Everywhere the fool
is unhappy at heart,
not concentrated on virtues.
Right here he gains honor
and after death, in heaven,
is happy at heart:
Everywhere the enlightened one
is happy at heart,
well-concentrated on virtues.
Here virtue is supreme,
but one with discernment is the ultimate.
Among human beings & devas
one conquers
through virtue & discernment.

reverence.<br>He—the supreme man—stood still<br>out of sympathy<br>just<br>for me.<br>After paying homage<br>to the feet of the teacher,<br>I stood to one side<br>& requested the Going Forth from him,<br>supreme among all living beings.<br>The compassionate Teacher,<br>sympathetic to all the world, said:<br>“Come, monk.”<br>That was my formal Acceptance.<br>Alone, I stayed in the

with a squadron of devas,<br>the Teacher smiled & said:<br>“Through austerity, celibacy,<br>restraint, & self-control:<br>That’s how one is a brahman.<br>He is a brahman supreme.”</p><h2
