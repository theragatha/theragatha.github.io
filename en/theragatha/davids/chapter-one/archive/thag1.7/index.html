He, with his elder brother Tapussa,[1] was born in the time of our Exalted One, in the city of Pokkharavatī, as the son of a caravan-driver. As they were conducting a caravan of carts in a pleasant glade, a muddy place checked their progress. Then a tree-fairy, one of their own kin, showed himself, and said: ‘Sirs, the Exalted One hath just attained enlightenment, and for seven weeks abideth fasting in the bliss of emancipation, seated at the root of the King’s [13] Stead tree.[2] Serve him with food; this will long make for your good and happiness.’ They, with joyful eagerness, waited not to prepare food, but took rice-cakes and honey, and, leaving the high road, ministered to the Exalted One.

As they were conducting a caravan of carts in a pleasant glade, a muddy place checked their progress. Then a tree-fairy, one of their own kin, showed himself, and said: &lsquo;Sirs, the Exalted One hath just attained enlightenment, and for seven weeks abideth fasting in the bliss of emancipation, seated at the root of the King&rsquo;s [13] Stead tree.[2] Serve him with food; this will long make for your good and happiness.&rsquo; They, with joyful eagerness, waited not to prepare food, but took rice-cakes and honey, and, leaving the high road, ministered to the Exalted One.</p><p>Now when the Exalted One had set rolling the wheel of the Norm at Benares,[3] he stayed in due course at Rājagaha. There Tapussa and Bhalliya waited on him and heard him teach. The former became a lay-follower, the latter left the world and mastered the six forms of abhiññā.[4]</p><p>One day when Mara[5] appeared to the Brother in fearsome terrifying shape, Bhalliya, manifesting how he had passed beyond all fear, uttered a psalm to Mara&rsquo;s discomfiture:</p><p>[7] Whoso hath chased away the Death-king and his host,
E&rsquo;en as a mighty flood the causeway of frail reeds,
Victor is he, self-tamed. Fear cometh never more.
His is the Goal supreme, and utter steadfastness.</p><p>Thus verily did the venerable Bhalliya utter his psalm.[6]&rsquo;</p><p>[1] In the Commentarial tradition, they were brothers in like circumstances, when Kassapa Buddha lived, and rendered like service then to Kassapa, entreating that they might repeat it in a future life.</p><p>[2] Cf. Sisters, p. 5. This story occurs in Vinaya Texts, iii. 81, and in the &lsquo;Nidāna-Kathā,&rsquo; Bud. Birth Stories, p. 110, Bhalliya being there Bhalluka and Bhalluka. Ika and iya are interchangeable adjectival terminations.</p><p>[3] His first sermon, etc.</p><p>[4] Supernormal thought. Cf. p. 82, n. 1.</p><p>[5] Professor Windisch holds there may have been a collection of such Māra or Devil legends (Māra und Buddha, 134).</p><p>Obiter dictum. Passing remark.</p><p>p.p. explains it all — p.p.</p><p>[6] Henceforth this obiter dictum ceases.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div></div><div></div></div><div class=book-comments></div><script>(function(){document.querySelectorAll("pre:has(code)").forEach(e=>{e.addEventListener("click",e.focus),e.addEventListener("copy",function(t){if(t.preventDefault(),navigator.clipboard){const t=window.getSelection().toString()||e.textContent;navigator.clipboard.writeText(t)}})})})()</script></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
