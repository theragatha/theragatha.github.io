Lit., not &lsquo;age,&rsquo; but arising, advent. The period, however, includes the whole, i.e., the last life, of the great tcacher; hence only &lsquo;age&rsquo; seemed to fit. The phrase alternates with kālo, samayo, &rsquo;time.&rsquo;</p><p>[^2] Pronounced Kott&rsquo;hita. The name is also recorded as Koṭṭhika and Koṭika. The Thera is evidently the one included among the &lsquo;Great Elders&rsquo; in Vinaya and Suttanta, the interlocutor in several Suttas - e.g., Majjhima Nikāya, i. 292; Saṁyutta Nik., ii. 112; Ang. Nik., i. 24, etc. See Vinaya Texts, ii. 112, 317; iii. 359.</p><p>[^3] On this technical phrase, see Sisters, p. 17, n. 1.</p><p>[^4] A title of the Buddha, frequent in scholastic works. It was at first applied equally to Arahants. Cf. Ang., ii. 63; Saṇy, ii. 28. The powers are enumerated in Majjh., i. 69-71.</p><p>[^5] Ang., i. 23; Majjh., i. 232.</p><p>[^6] Manta or mantras, an allusion to his brahmin or Vedic training. The next two phrases are a rendering of the one word anuddhato, which the Commentary connects with uddhacca, excitement.</p><p>[^7] Māluto, wind, may possibly have ceased to suggest the Vedic Māruts, ur wind-gods, at this date. Cf. Sisters, p. 150.</p><h2 id=notes>Notes<a class=anchor href=#notes>#</a></h2></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div></div><div></div></div><div class=book-comments></div><script>(function(){document.querySelectorAll("pre:has(code)").forEach(e=>{e.addEventListener("click",e.focus),e.addEventListener("copy",function(t){if(t.preventDefault(),navigator.clipboard){const t=window.getSelection().toString()||e.textContent;navigator.clipboard.writeText(t)}})})})()</script></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#notes>Notes</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
