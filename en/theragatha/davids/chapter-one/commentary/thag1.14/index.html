When his mother heard that her eldest brother Vanavaccha had left the world, had graduated in the Order, and was dwelling in the forest, she said to her son: ‘Dear Sīvaka, you should leave the world under the Elder, and wait on him; the Elder is getting old now.’ He, at this sole bidding of his mother, and because of his previous aspirations, did so and, ministering to his uncle, dwelt in the forest.

And when medicine did not cure him and he came not, the Elder, wondering at the reason, went and found him ill. Administering remedies and tending him the Elder, when dawn was nigh, said: ‘Sīvaka, since the time when I left the world, I have not sojourned in the village. Let us go hence into the forest.’ Sivaka answered: ‘Sir, even if my body stay now by the village, my heart is in the forest, wherefore though I lie here yet shall I go thither.’ Then the Elder took hold of his arm and led him to the forest exhorting him. He, made steadfast by that admonition, won arahantship.
