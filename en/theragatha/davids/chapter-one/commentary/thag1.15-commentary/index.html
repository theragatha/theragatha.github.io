As the legend throws no light on the verse, it is not given here, nor is the account of his prior rank in receiving food-tickets (see Ang., i. 24 ), and for the same reason. The verse might, in fact, have been spoken by any learned Thera (cf. CCXLII., verse 633 ). Subhaddā is presumably the daughter of Anāthapiṇḍika, living at Sāketa ( Milinda, ii. 308). The way to her (from Sāvatthī) is described as being far: in Majjh., i. 149, as seven express coaching stages.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>I.e., on the Etad-agga-Vagga (Ang., i. 28 f.) , wherein the Thera&rsquo;s success is recorded. It is noticeable that, in citing this Commentary, Dhammapāla does not quote it as Buddhaghosa&rsquo;s Manorathapūraṇī.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p>According to the Commentary, the first of these four pentads is the group of the five lower Fetters ( Bud. Psy., §§ 1113-1134; Rhys Davids, American Lectures, p. 141 ff. ). The second pentad is the remaining five Fetters, the liberation from the ten involving deliverance from rebirth. The third refers to the five moral powers or faculties ( Bud. Psy., §§ 305-311), and the fourth to the bonds of passion, hate, stupidity, pride, and opinion ( Vibhanga, p. 877). The verse occurs in Dhammapada, v. 370, and Saṁyutta Nik., i. 8, and below, 633, where this comment is repeated. The verse is a good example of the kind of holy riddle in which these Elders (like others nearer home) took special delight. (Cf.
