If it means &lsquo;renounced the world a year ago&rsquo; ( vide Neumann), it is curious that Dhammapāla does not paraphrase by the term saṇvacchara. Is it not perhaps permissible, in view of the strong emphasis on the order (lit., &lsquo;Normity&rsquo;) of the Norm, to see a parallel between two strands of the fivefold order (niyama) of the universe: - the seasons and the Norm (utu-niyama, dhamma-niyama) ? ( Cf. Dialogues of the Buddha, ii 8, n. 3, and my Buddhism, 118 f. ) The fruition-namely, of his moral and spiritual evolution - was as certain and inevitable as that &lsquo;seedtime and harvest, &mldr; summer and winter shall not cease&rsquo; (Gen. viii. 22). The phrase, however, recurs frequently with no such point.&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div></div><div></div></div><div class=book-comments></div><script>(function(){document.querySelectorAll("pre:has(code)").forEach(e=>{e.addEventListener("click",e.focus),e.addEventListener("copy",function(t){if(t.preventDefault(),navigator.clipboard){const t=window.getSelection().toString()||e.textContent;navigator.clipboard.writeText(t)}})})})()</script></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#commentary>Commentary</a></li><li><a href=#verses>Verses</a></li><li><a href=#attribution>Attribution</a></li><li><a href=#notes>Notes</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
