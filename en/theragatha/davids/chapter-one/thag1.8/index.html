Thereupon, [14] seeing the trouble in the perpetuation of life,[2] he left the world in anguish, and putting forth every effort soon acquired sixfold abhiññā. Now when, as arahant, he was living in the bliss of fruition, his former wife tried to lure him back in various ways. But the venerable Vira said:

Vira, from doubts released, content, serene;
Victor is Vira, free from creeping dread;
