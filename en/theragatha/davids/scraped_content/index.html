PSALMS OF THE BRETHREN Canto V. Psalms of Five Verses CC Girimānanda Translated from the Pali by Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids. Public Domain [Index][Pali] Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha as the son of King Bimbisāra’s chaplain, he was named Girimānanda. He saw the power and majesty of a Buddha when the Master attended the meeting at Rājagaha, and he entered the Order. During his studies he stayed awhile at a village, then came back to the town to salute the Master. And Bimbisāra the maharāja heard of his coming, and going to him, said: ‘Do you dwell here, your reverence; I will supply your needs.’ But from his much business he forgot, so that the Thera dwelt in the open. And the weather-gods held off the rain for fear of wetting the Thera. Then the king, noting the drought, built him a hermitage. And the Thera, sheltered in his hut, put forth all his efforts, and combining energy and calm, conjured up insight and won arahantship. Then, delighted at its advent, he confessed aññā while the rain fell from above: [325] God rains as ’twere a melody most sweet. Snug is my little hut, sheltered, well-roofed. Therein I dwell, my heart serene and calm. Now an it pleaseth thee to rain, god, rain! [326] God rains as ’twere a melody most sweet. Snug is my little hut, sheltered, well-roofed.

[Index][Pali]
 
Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha as the son of King Bimbisāra&rsquo;s chaplain, he was named Girimānanda. He saw the power and majesty of a Buddha when the Master attended the meeting at Rājagaha, and he entered the Order. During his studies he stayed awhile at a village, then came back to the town to salute the Master. And Bimbisāra the maharāja heard of his coming, and going to him, said: &lsquo;Do you dwell here, your reverence; I will supply your needs.&rsquo; But from his much business he forgot, so that the Thera dwelt in the open. And the weather-gods held off the rain for fear of wetting the Thera. Then the king, noting the drought, built him a hermitage. And the Thera, sheltered in his hut, put forth all his efforts, and combining energy and calm, conjured up insight and won arahantship. Then, delighted at its advent, he confessed aññā while the rain fell from above:
[325] God rains as &rsquo;twere a melody most sweet.
Snug is my little hut, sheltered, well-roofed.
Therein I dwell, my heart serene and calm.
Now an it pleaseth thee to rain, god, rain!
[326] God rains as &rsquo;twere a melody most sweet.
Snug is my little hut, sheltered, well-roofed.
Therein I dwell, and peace within my heart.
Now, etc.
[327] [193] Therein I dwell, all passion purged away.
&mldr;&mldr;&mldr;..
[328] Therein I dwell, all hatred purged away.
&mldr;&mldr;&mldr;..
[329] Therein I dwell, all error purged away.
Now an it pleaseth thee to rain, god, rain![1]
