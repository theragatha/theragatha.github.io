&lt;!-- ## Commentary --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reborn in the time of our Buddha at Sāvatthī, in the family of councillor Sumana, younger brother of Anāthapiṇḍika, he was named Subhūti.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now on the day when the Jeta Grove, purchased by his uncle, was presented to the Exalted One, Subhūti was present, and when he heard the Norm, he found faith and left the world. Receiving ordination, he mastered the two categories (of Vinaya rules).&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thereafter a subject for exercise in meditation was given him to learn, and he went into the forest and practised it. Developing insight on the basis of love-jhāna,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; he won arahantship. And he, teaching the Norm without distinctions or limitations, became chief among the brethren who cultivated universal amity. And because, while going round for alms, he fell, at house after house, [5] into love-jhāna, taking his alms when he emerged from reverie, this was judged to bring great reward to his almoners, and he became chief among them that were held worthy of gifts. Wherefore the Exalted One said: &amp;lsquo;Subhūti, bhikkhus, is the chief of my bhikkhu-disciples in universal&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; amity, and chief among such as are held worthy of gifts.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.1 Subhūti</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="11-subhūti"&gt;1.1 Subhūti&lt;a class="anchor" href="#11-subh%c5%abti"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Again &amp;amp; again grain comes to the kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
Again &amp;amp; again beggars wander.&lt;br&gt;
Again &amp;amp; again lords of giving give.&lt;br&gt;

Seclusion is for meditators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just as the wind in Verambhā&lt;br&gt;

So the city scatters&lt;br&gt;
My perceptions connected with seclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

The crow that lives in the charnel ground&lt;br&gt;

like a bird&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; exposed to the rain?&lt;br&gt;
Monsoons refresh you,&lt;br&gt;
for seclusion is for those in jhāna.&lt;br&gt;
As the monsoon wind&lt;br&gt;
drives the clouds in the rainy season,&lt;br&gt;
so thoughts concerned with seclusion&lt;br&gt;
impel me.&lt;br&gt;

A black crow&lt;br&gt;
making its home in a charnel ground&lt;br&gt;

mindfulness in—&lt;br&gt;

One whom others don’t guard,&lt;br&gt;
who doesn’t guard others:&lt;br&gt;
He is a monk&lt;br&gt;
who lies down in ease,&lt;br&gt;
unconcerned with sensual passions.&lt;br&gt;
* * *
With clear waters &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
massive boulders,&lt;br&gt;
frequented by monkeys &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
deer,&lt;br&gt;
covered with moss &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
water weeds:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
* * *
I’ve lived in wildernesses,&lt;br&gt;
canyons, &amp;amp; caves,&lt;br&gt;
isolated dwellings&lt;br&gt;
frequented by predator &amp;amp; prey,&lt;br&gt;
but never have I known&lt;br&gt;
an ignoble, aversive resolve:&lt;br&gt;
“May these beings&lt;br&gt;
be destroyed,&lt;br&gt;
be slaughtered,&lt;br&gt;
fall into pain.”&lt;br&gt;
* * *
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done;&lt;br&gt;
the heavy load, laid down;&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming,&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; uprooted.&lt;br&gt;
And the goal for which I went forth&lt;br&gt;
from home life into homelessness&lt;br&gt;
I’ve reached:&lt;br&gt;
the end&lt;br&gt;
of all fetters.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time&lt;br&gt;
as a worker his wage.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time,&lt;br&gt;
mindful, alert.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>12.1 Sīlava</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-twelve/thag12.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-twelve/thag12.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="121-sīlava"&gt;12.1 Sīlava&lt;a class="anchor" href="#121-s%c4%ablava"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should train just in virtue,&lt;br&gt;
For in this world, when virtue is&lt;br&gt;
Cultivated and well-trained,&lt;br&gt;
It provides all success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desiring three kinds of happiness—&lt;br&gt;
Praise, prosperity,&lt;br&gt;
And to delight in heaven after passing away—&lt;br&gt;
The wise should protect virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-behaved have many friends,&lt;br&gt;
Because of their self-restraint.&lt;br&gt;
But one without virtue, of bad conduct,&lt;br&gt;
Drives away their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person of bad behavior has&lt;br&gt;
Ill-repute and infamy.&lt;br&gt;
A person of virtue always has&lt;br&gt;
A good reputation, fame, and praise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>12.1 Sīlavat</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-twelve/thag12.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-twelve/thag12.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="121-sīlavat"&gt;12.1 Sīlavat&lt;a class="anchor" href="#121-s%c4%ablavat"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here master the virtue&lt;br&gt;
that in this world is well-mastered,&lt;br&gt;
for virtue, when cultivated,&lt;br&gt;
brings every consummation near.&lt;br&gt;
Wise, one should protect one’s virtue,&lt;br&gt;
aspiring to three pleasures:&lt;br&gt;
praise, the gaining of wealth,&lt;br&gt;
and—after death—rejoicing in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
The virtuous one, through restraint,&lt;br&gt;
acquires many friends,&lt;br&gt;
while the unvirtuous one, practicing evil,&lt;br&gt;
from friends is estranged.&lt;br&gt;
The unvirtuous person gains&lt;br&gt;
disrepute &amp;amp; dishonor;&lt;br&gt;
the virtuous person, always,&lt;br&gt;
repute, honor, &amp;amp; praise.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue is the beginning, the establishing,&lt;br&gt;
the mother of what is fine,&lt;br&gt;
the foremost of all qualities:&lt;br&gt;
Therefore virtue should be purified.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue is also control, restraint,&lt;br&gt;
the delight of the mind,&lt;br&gt;
the ford of all Buddhas:&lt;br&gt;
Therefore virtue should be purified.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an incomparable strength.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the ultimate weapon.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the highest adornment.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an astounding coat of mail.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an imposing bridge.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an unexcelled fragrance.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the highest fragrant ointment&lt;br&gt;
by which one wafts&lt;br&gt;
this direction &amp;amp; that.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the supreme provision.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the ultimate food for the journey.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the highest vehicle&lt;br&gt;
by which one goes&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
this direction &amp;amp; that.&lt;br&gt;
Right here he gains blame,&lt;br&gt;
and after death, in deprivation,&lt;br&gt;
he’s unhappy at heart:&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere the fool&lt;br&gt;
is unhappy at heart,&lt;br&gt;
not concentrated on virtues.&lt;br&gt;
Right here he gains honor&lt;br&gt;
and after death, in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
is happy at heart:&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere the enlightened one&lt;br&gt;
is happy at heart,&lt;br&gt;
well-concentrated on virtues.&lt;br&gt;
Here virtue is supreme,&lt;br&gt;
but one with discernment is the ultimate.&lt;br&gt;
Among human beings &amp;amp; devas&lt;br&gt;
one conquers&lt;br&gt;
through virtue &amp;amp; discernment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>13.1 Soṇa Koḷivisa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-thirteen/thag13.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-thirteen/thag13.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="131-soṇa-koḷivisa"&gt;13.1 Soṇa Koḷivisa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#131-so%e1%b9%87a-ko%e1%b8%b7ivisa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

because what should be done is cast aside,&lt;br&gt;
what shouldn’t be done is done.&lt;br&gt;
For those who are insolent, heedless,&lt;br&gt;
their effluents increase.&lt;br&gt;
But those whose mindfulness immersed in the body&lt;br&gt;
is constantly well-undertaken,&lt;br&gt;
—who don’t engage in what shouldn’t be done,&lt;br&gt;
who persevere in what should be done,&lt;br&gt;
mindful, alert—&lt;br&gt;
their effluents go to their end.&lt;br&gt;
Go by the straight path pointed out,&lt;br&gt;
don’t turn back.&lt;br&gt;
You yourself should reprove yourself&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
should advance to unbinding.&lt;br&gt;
When I overexerted my effort,&lt;br&gt;
the Teacher unexcelled in the world,&lt;br&gt;
the One with Eyes,&lt;br&gt;
making the lute simile,&lt;br&gt;
taught me the Dhamma.&lt;br&gt;
I, having heard his words,&lt;br&gt;
dwelled delighting in his bidding.&lt;br&gt;
I practiced in tune,&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
attaining the foremost goal.&lt;br&gt;
The three knowledges are attained.&lt;br&gt;
The Buddha’s bidding, done.&lt;br&gt;
When one’s awareness is dedicated&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
to renunciation, seclusion,&lt;br&gt;
non-afflictiveness, the ending of clinging,&lt;br&gt;
the ending of craving, &amp;amp; non-deludedness,&lt;br&gt;
seeing the arising of the sense media,&lt;br&gt;
the mind is rightly released.&lt;br&gt;
For that monk, rightly released,&lt;br&gt;
his heart at peace.&lt;br&gt;
There’s nothing to be done,&lt;br&gt;
nothing to add&lt;br&gt;
to what’s done.&lt;br&gt;
As a single mass of rock isn’t moved by the wind,&lt;br&gt;
even so all&lt;br&gt;
forms, flavors, sounds,&lt;br&gt;
aromas, contacts,&lt;br&gt;
ideas desirable &amp;amp; not,&lt;br&gt;
have no effect on one who is Such.&lt;br&gt;
The mind&lt;br&gt;
—still, totally released—&lt;br&gt;
focuses on&lt;br&gt;
their passing away.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>13.1 Soṇakoḷivisa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-thirteen/thag13.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-thirteen/thag13.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="131-soṇakoḷivisa"&gt;13.1 Soṇakoḷivisa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#131-so%e1%b9%87ako%e1%b8%b7ivisa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who was special in the kingdom,&lt;br&gt;
The attendant to the king of Aṅga,&lt;br&gt;
Today is special in the Dhamma—&lt;br&gt;
Soṇa has gone beyond suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five should be cut off, five should be abandoned,&lt;br&gt;
Five should be developed further.&lt;br&gt;
A monk who has gone beyond&lt;br&gt;
Five attachments is called&lt;br&gt;
“One who has crossed the flood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a monk is insolent and negligent,&lt;br&gt;
Concerned only with externals,&lt;br&gt;
Their virtue, samādhi, and understanding&lt;br&gt;
Do not become fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>14.1 Khadiravaniyarevata</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-fourteen/thag14.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-fourteen/thag14.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="141-khadiravaniyarevata"&gt;14.1 Khadiravaniyarevata&lt;a class="anchor" href="#141-khadiravaniyarevata"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve gone forth&lt;br&gt;
From home life into homelessness,&lt;br&gt;
I’m not aware of any intention&lt;br&gt;
That is ignoble and hateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“May these beings be killed!&lt;br&gt;
May they be slaughtered!&lt;br&gt;
May they suffer!”—&lt;br&gt;
I’m not aware of having any such intentions&lt;br&gt;
In all this long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been aware of loving-kindness,&lt;br&gt;
Measureless and well-developed,&lt;br&gt;
Gradually built up,&lt;br&gt;
Just as the Buddha taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m friend and comrade to all,&lt;br&gt;
Compassionate to all beings,&lt;br&gt;
Developing a mind of loving-kindness,&lt;br&gt;
And always delighting in harmlessness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>14.1 Revata’s Farewell</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-fourteen/thag14.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-fourteen/thag14.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="141-revatas-farewell"&gt;14.1 Revata’s Farewell&lt;a class="anchor" href="#141-revatas-farewell"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I went forth&lt;br&gt;
from home into homelessness,&lt;br&gt;
I haven’t known&lt;br&gt;
an ignoble, aversive resolve.&lt;br&gt;
“May these beings&lt;br&gt;
be destroyed,&lt;br&gt;
be slaughtered,&lt;br&gt;
fall into pain”—&lt;br&gt;
I’ve not known this resolve&lt;br&gt;
in this long, long time.&lt;br&gt;
But I have known goodwill,&lt;br&gt;
unlimited,&lt;br&gt;
fully developed,&lt;br&gt;
nurtured step after step,&lt;br&gt;
as taught by the One&lt;br&gt;
Awake:&lt;br&gt;
to all, a friend;&lt;br&gt;
to all, a comrade;&lt;br&gt;
for all beings, sympathetic.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And I develop a mind of goodwill,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in non-malevolence&lt;br&gt;
—always.&lt;br&gt;
Unvanquished, unshaken,&lt;br&gt;
I gladden the mind.&lt;br&gt;
I develop the sublime abiding,&lt;br&gt;
not frequented by&lt;br&gt;
the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
Attaining no-thinking,&lt;br&gt;
the disciple of the Rightly&lt;br&gt;
Self-awakened One&lt;br&gt;
is endowed with noble silence&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
straightaway.&lt;br&gt;
As a mountain of rock&lt;br&gt;
is unmoving,&lt;br&gt;
firmly established,&lt;br&gt;
so a monk,&lt;br&gt;
with the ending of delusion,&lt;br&gt;
like a mountain,&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t quake.&lt;br&gt;
To a person without blemish,&lt;br&gt;
in constant quest of what’s pure,&lt;br&gt;
a hair-tip of evil&lt;br&gt;
seems a storm cloud.&lt;br&gt;
As a frontier fortress is guarded&lt;br&gt;
within &amp;amp; without,&lt;br&gt;
you should safeguard yourselves.&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let the moment&lt;br&gt;
pass you by.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time&lt;br&gt;
like a worker his wage.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time,&lt;br&gt;
mindful, alert.&lt;br&gt;
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done;&lt;br&gt;
the heavy load, laid down;&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming, uprooted.&lt;br&gt;
And the goal for which I went forth&lt;br&gt;
from home life into homelessness&lt;br&gt;
I’ve reached:&lt;br&gt;
the end&lt;br&gt;
of all fetters.&lt;br&gt;
Attain consummation&lt;br&gt;
through heedfulness:&lt;br&gt;
That is my message.&lt;br&gt;
So then, I’m about to&lt;br&gt;
unbind.&lt;br&gt;
I’m released&lt;br&gt;

Dispassion was the Dhamma that was taught,&lt;br&gt;
Without any grasping at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many pretty things&lt;br&gt;
In the circle of this earth;&lt;br&gt;
They disturb one’s thoughts, I believe,&lt;br&gt;
Beautiful, provoking lust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a rain cloud would settle&lt;br&gt;
The dust blown up by the wind;&lt;br&gt;
So thoughts settle down&lt;br&gt;
When seen with understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All conditions are impermanent—&lt;br&gt;
When this is seen with understanding,&lt;br&gt;
One turns away from suffering:&lt;br&gt;
This is the path to purity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>16.1 Adhimutta &amp; the Bandits</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-sixteen/thag16.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-sixteen/thag16.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="161-adhimutta--the-bandits"&gt;16.1 Adhimutta &amp;amp; the Bandits&lt;a class="anchor" href="#161-adhimutta--the-bandits"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bandit chief:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Those who&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of sacrifice&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of wealth&lt;br&gt;
we have killed in the past,&lt;br&gt;
against their will&lt;br&gt;
have trembled &amp;amp; babbled&lt;br&gt;
from fear.&lt;br&gt;
But you—&lt;br&gt;
you show no fear;&lt;br&gt;
your complexion brightens.&lt;br&gt;
Why don’t you lament&lt;br&gt;
in the face of what’s greatly to be feared?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ven. Adhimutta:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“There are no painful mind-states, chieftain,&lt;br&gt;
in one without longing.&lt;br&gt;
In one whose fetters are ended,&lt;br&gt;
all fears are overcome.&lt;br&gt;
With the ending of [craving]&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming,&lt;br&gt;
when phenomena are seen&lt;br&gt;
for what they are,&lt;br&gt;
then as in the laying down of a burden,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no fear in death.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve lived well the holy life,&lt;br&gt;
well-developed the path.&lt;br&gt;
Death holds no fear for me.&lt;br&gt;
It’s like the end of a disease.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve lived well the holy life,&lt;br&gt;
well-developed the path,&lt;br&gt;
seen states of becoming&lt;br&gt;
as devoid of allure,&lt;br&gt;
like poison spit out&lt;br&gt;
after it’s drunk.&lt;br&gt;
One gone to the far shore&lt;br&gt;
without clinging,&lt;br&gt;
effluent-free,&lt;br&gt;
his task completed,&lt;br&gt;
welcomes the ending of life,&lt;br&gt;
as if freed from a place of execution.&lt;br&gt;
Having attained the supreme Rightness,&lt;br&gt;
unconcerned with all the world,&lt;br&gt;
as if released from a burning house,&lt;br&gt;
he doesn’t sorrow at death.&lt;br&gt;
Whatever’s compounded,&lt;br&gt;
wherever a state of becoming’s obtained,&lt;br&gt;
all that has no one in charge:&lt;br&gt;
So says the Great Seer.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever discerns this,&lt;br&gt;
as taught by the Awakened One,&lt;br&gt;
would no more grasp hold&lt;br&gt;
of any state of becoming&lt;br&gt;
than he would&lt;br&gt;
a hot iron ball.&lt;br&gt;
I have no ‘I was,’&lt;br&gt;
no ‘I will be.’&lt;br&gt;
Fabrications will simply&lt;br&gt;
go out of existence.&lt;br&gt;
What’s to lament there in that?&lt;br&gt;
For one who sees, as it actually is,&lt;br&gt;
the pure arising of phenomena,&lt;br&gt;
the pure seriality of fabrications,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no fear.&lt;br&gt;
When seeing the world,&lt;br&gt;
with discernment,&lt;br&gt;
as on a par&lt;br&gt;
with grass &amp;amp; twigs,&lt;br&gt;
finding no ‘mine-ness,’&lt;br&gt;
thinking, ‘There’s nothing of mine,’&lt;br&gt;
he feels no sorrow.&lt;br&gt;
Dissatisfied with this carcass,&lt;br&gt;
I’m unconcerned with becoming.&lt;br&gt;
This body will break up&lt;br&gt;
and there will not be another.&lt;br&gt;
Do as you like with this carcass.&lt;br&gt;
From that I will feel&lt;br&gt;
neither hatred nor love.”&lt;br&gt;
Hearing these awesome, hair-raising words,&lt;br&gt;
the young men threw down their weapons &amp;amp; said:&lt;br&gt;
“What have you done, sir,&lt;br&gt;
or who have you taken as mentor?&lt;br&gt;
Because of whose teachings&lt;br&gt;
is this lack of sorrow acquired?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ven. Adhimutta:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“The all-knowing,&lt;br&gt;
all-seeing conqueror:&lt;br&gt;
He is my mentor.&lt;br&gt;
Greatly compassionate teacher,&lt;br&gt;
all the world’s healer,&lt;br&gt;
this doctrine is his,&lt;br&gt;
unexcelled, leading to ending.&lt;br&gt;
Because of his teachings&lt;br&gt;
is this lack of sorrow acquired.”&lt;br&gt;
The bandits, hearing the good words of the seer,&lt;br&gt;
threw down their swords &amp;amp; their weapons.&lt;br&gt;
Some relinquished their life of crime,&lt;br&gt;
some chose the Going-forth.&lt;br&gt;
Having gone forth in the teachings&lt;br&gt;
of the One Well-Gone,&lt;br&gt;
developing the strengths&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; factors for awakening,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
wise, happy,&lt;br&gt;
exultant in mind,&lt;br&gt;
their faculties ripened,&lt;br&gt;
they touched uncompounded unbinding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>17.1 Phussa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-seventeen/thag17.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-seventeen/thag17.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="171-phussa"&gt;17.1 Phussa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#171-phussa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Fellowship with many people&lt;br&gt;

A sage shouldn’t visit families:&lt;br&gt;

They know it’s a bog—&lt;br&gt;
the reverence &amp;amp; veneration&lt;br&gt;

a subtle arrow, hard to extract.&lt;br&gt;
Offerings are hard for a worthless man&lt;br&gt;

Coming down from my dwelling place,&lt;br&gt;

stood courteously next to a leper&lt;br&gt;

He, with his rotting hand,&lt;br&gt;

a finger fell off&lt;br&gt;
right there.&lt;br&gt;
Sitting next to a wall,&lt;br&gt;
I ate that morsel of food,&lt;br&gt;

He’s eager &amp;amp; greedy for flavors,&lt;br&gt;
whoever misses the goal&lt;br&gt;
that brings bliss.&lt;br&gt;
One shouldn’t do lots of work,&lt;br&gt;
should avoid&lt;br&gt;
what doesn’t lead to the goal.&lt;br&gt;
The body gets wearied,&lt;br&gt;
fatigued.&lt;br&gt;
Aching, one finds&lt;br&gt;
no tranquility.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
Simply by flapping the mouth&lt;br&gt;
one doesn’t see&lt;br&gt;
even oneself.&lt;br&gt;
One goes around stiff-&lt;br&gt;
necked,&lt;br&gt;
thinking, ‘I’m better&lt;br&gt;
than they.’&lt;br&gt;
Not better,&lt;br&gt;
he thinks himself better,&lt;br&gt;
the fool:&lt;br&gt;
The wise don’t praise him,&lt;br&gt;
the stiff-necked man.&lt;br&gt;
But whoever isn’t stirred&lt;br&gt;
by the modes of&lt;br&gt;
‘I’m better,&lt;br&gt;
not better.&lt;br&gt;
I’m worse.&lt;br&gt;
I’m like that’;&lt;br&gt;
one who’s discerning,&lt;br&gt;
who acts as he says,&lt;br&gt;
well-centered&lt;br&gt;
in virtues,&lt;br&gt;
committed to&lt;br&gt;
tranquility of awareness, he&lt;br&gt;
is the one&lt;br&gt;
the wise&lt;br&gt;
would praise.&lt;br&gt;
One with no respect&lt;br&gt;
for his fellows in the holy life,&lt;br&gt;
is as far&lt;br&gt;
from true Dhamma&lt;br&gt;
as the earth&lt;br&gt;
from the sky.&lt;br&gt;
But those whose sense of shame&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; compunction&lt;br&gt;
are always rightly established: They&lt;br&gt;
have flourished in the holy life.&lt;br&gt;
For them&lt;br&gt;
there’s no further becoming.&lt;br&gt;
A monk conceited &amp;amp; vain,&lt;br&gt;
even though clad&lt;br&gt;
in a robe of cast-off rags,&lt;br&gt;
like a monkey in a lion’s skin,&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t shine because of it.&lt;br&gt;
But a monk not conceited&lt;br&gt;
or vain,&lt;br&gt;
masterful,&lt;br&gt;
his faculties restrained, shines&lt;br&gt;
because of his robe of cast-off rags,&lt;br&gt;
like a lion&lt;br&gt;
in the cleft of a mountain.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
These many devas,&lt;br&gt;
powerful, prestigious&lt;br&gt;
—10,000 devas—&lt;br&gt;
all of Brahmā’s retinue,&lt;br&gt;
stand with their hands over their hearts,&lt;br&gt;
paying homage to Sāriputta,&lt;br&gt;
the Dhamma-general,&lt;br&gt;
enlightened,&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
centered,&lt;br&gt;
great master of jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
[saying:]&lt;br&gt;
‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred man.&lt;br&gt;
Homage to you, O superlative man—&lt;br&gt;
of whom we have no direct knowledge&lt;br&gt;
even of that&lt;br&gt;
in dependence on which&lt;br&gt;
you do jhāna.&lt;br&gt;
‘How very amazing:&lt;br&gt;
the awakened ones’&lt;br&gt;
very own deep range—&lt;br&gt;
of which we have no direct knowledge,&lt;br&gt;
though we have come&lt;br&gt;
as hair-splitting archers.’&lt;br&gt;
Seeing Sāriputta,&lt;br&gt;
a man worthy of worship,&lt;br&gt;
worshipped by deva retinues,&lt;br&gt;
Kappina&lt;br&gt;
smiled.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
As far as this buddha-field&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; extends&lt;br&gt;
—except for the great sage himself—&lt;br&gt;
I’m the one&lt;br&gt;
outstanding&lt;br&gt;
in ascetic qualities.&lt;br&gt;
There’s no one else&lt;br&gt;
like me.&lt;br&gt;
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done;&lt;br&gt;
the heavy load, laid down;&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming, uprooted.&lt;br&gt;
Neither to robe,&lt;br&gt;
nor dwelling,&lt;br&gt;
nor food&lt;br&gt;
does he cling:&lt;br&gt;
Gotama,&lt;br&gt;
like a lotus unspotted&lt;br&gt;
by water, inclining&lt;br&gt;
to renunciation, detached&lt;br&gt;
from the three planes of becoming.&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He,&lt;br&gt;
the great sage,&lt;br&gt;
has the establishings of mindfulness&lt;br&gt;
as his neck,&lt;br&gt;
conviction&lt;br&gt;
as hands,&lt;br&gt;
discernment&lt;br&gt;
as head.&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Having great knowledge,&lt;br&gt;
he goes about&lt;br&gt;
always unbound.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>18.1 Mahākassapa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-eighteen/thag18.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-eighteen/thag18.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="181-mahākassapa"&gt;18.1 Mahākassapa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#181-mah%c4%81kassapa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t live for the adulation of a following;&lt;br&gt;
It turns your mind, and makes samādhi hard to find.&lt;br&gt;
Seeing that popularity is suﬀering,&lt;br&gt;
You shouldn’t accept a following.&lt;/p&gt;

To which an ignorant unawakened person is bound—&lt;br&gt;
Are suffering; and they are mindful, practising jhāna:&lt;br&gt;
There is no greater pleasure than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When attachment, the carrier of suffering,&lt;br&gt;
And craving, the carrier of the suffering&lt;br&gt;
Of this mass of proliferation,&lt;br&gt;
Are destroyed; and they are mindful, practising jhāna:&lt;br&gt;
There is no greater pleasure than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the blissful eightfold way,&lt;br&gt;
The supreme path, cleanser of all stains,&lt;br&gt;
Is seen with wisdom;&lt;br&gt;
And they are mindful, practising jhāna:&lt;br&gt;
There is no greater pleasure than this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>9.1 Bhūta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-nine/thag9.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-nine/thag9.1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="91-bhūta"&gt;9.1 Bhūta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#91-bh%c5%abta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, knowing, “stress, aging-&amp;amp;-death”—&lt;br&gt;
where people run-of-the-mill are attached—&lt;br&gt;
comprehending stress,&lt;br&gt;
the wise man does jhāna, mindful,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;br&gt;
When, striking down&lt;br&gt;
attachment,&lt;br&gt;
the bringer of stress&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; craving,&lt;br&gt;
the bringer of stress bound up&lt;br&gt;
with objectification,&lt;br&gt;
he does jhāna, mindful,&lt;br&gt;

the auspicious, two-times-four road,&lt;br&gt;
the ultimate path,&lt;br&gt;
cleansing away all defilement,&lt;br&gt;
he does jhāna, mindful,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;br&gt;
When he develops the peaceful state,&lt;br&gt;
—sorrowless, stainless, unfabricated,&lt;br&gt;
cleansing away all defilement,&lt;br&gt;
cutting through fetters &amp;amp; bonds—&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;br&gt;
When, in the sky, the thundercloud roars,&lt;br&gt;
with torrents of rain on all sides&lt;br&gt;
of the path of the birds,&lt;br&gt;
and the monk, having gone to a cave, does jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;br&gt;
When, seated on the bank of rivers&lt;br&gt;
covered with flowers,&lt;br&gt;
garlanded with various forest plants,&lt;br&gt;
happy at heart, he does jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;br&gt;
When, at midnight in the secluded grove,&lt;br&gt;
the devas drizzle, the fanged animals roar,&lt;br&gt;
and the monk, having gone to a cave, does jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;br&gt;
When, having kept his own thoughts in check,&lt;br&gt;
taking refuge in the mountains in a mountain fissure,&lt;br&gt;
free from disturbance, free&lt;br&gt;
from barrenness,&lt;br&gt;
he does jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;br&gt;
When, happy,&lt;br&gt;
destroying stain, barrenness, grief,&lt;br&gt;
free from door-bolts, free from underbrush, free&lt;br&gt;
from arrows,&lt;br&gt;
having put an end to all effluents,&lt;br&gt;
he does jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no greater enjoyment than that.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chapter One</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-one/chapter-one/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-one/chapter-one/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="chapter-one"&gt;Chapter One&lt;a class="anchor" href="#chapter-one"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&gt;"ABRAHAM, the disciple of Abbot Sisois, said to him: Father, you are an
old man. Let’s go back to the world. Abbot Sisois replied: Very well,
we’ll go where there are no women. His disciple said: What is the
place in which there are no women, except the desert alone? The
elder replied to him: Therefore take me into the desert." (Merton, 2012)

&lt;p&gt;I’ll exchange old age for the un-ageing,&lt;br&gt;
Burning for extinguishing:&lt;br&gt;
The ultimate peace,&lt;br&gt;

To her beloved and only son;&lt;br&gt;
So, to creatures all and everywhere,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one who understands&lt;br&gt;
It’s always better not to mix with such women.&lt;br&gt;
I went from the village to the wilderness;&lt;br&gt;
From there I entered the house.&lt;br&gt;
Though I was there to be fed,&lt;br&gt;
I stood up and left without taking leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever is seeking happiness&lt;br&gt;
Will find it through this practice,&lt;br&gt;
Get a good reputation, and grow in renown:&lt;br&gt;
Develop the noble eightfold, straight, direct path&lt;br&gt;
For the realisation of the deathless.&lt;/p&gt;

Questions on the goal,&lt;br&gt;
Actions that are skilful,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some travel to diﬀerent regions,&lt;br&gt;
Wandering unrestrained.&lt;br&gt;
If they lose their stillness,&lt;br&gt;
What is the point&lt;br&gt;
Of wandering around the countries?&lt;br&gt;
So you should dispel pride,&lt;br&gt;
practising jhāna without distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

As if their head was on fire,&lt;br&gt;
A monk should go forth mindfully,&lt;br&gt;

Those intent upon good, seeing the goal.&lt;br&gt;
Being wise, heedful, and discerning,&lt;br&gt;

Hard to see, subtle, and fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was your old hut,&lt;br&gt;
But you still want a new hut.&lt;br&gt;
Dispel desire for a hut, monk!&lt;br&gt;
A new hut will only bring more suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little hut is pleasing, delightful,&lt;br&gt;
A gift given in faith.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve no need of girls:&lt;br&gt;
Go, ladies, to those in need!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went forth out of faith&lt;br&gt;
And built a little hut in the wilderness.&lt;br&gt;
I’m heedful, ardent,&lt;br&gt;
Aware, and mindful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monk who went to Sītavana is alone,&lt;br&gt;
Content, practicing samādhi,&lt;br&gt;
Victorious, with goosebumps vanished,&lt;br&gt;
Guarding mindfulness of the body, resolute.&lt;/p&gt;

Of entering this hut, have prospered.&lt;br&gt;
Abandoning the tendency to conceit,&lt;br&gt;
I’ll realise knowledge and liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

One who doesn’t see&lt;br&gt;
Sees neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dwell alone in the wilderness,&lt;br&gt;
Like a log rejected in a forest.&lt;br&gt;
Lots of people are jealous of me,&lt;br&gt;
Like beings in hell are jealous&lt;br&gt;
Of someone going to heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They died and fell;&lt;br&gt;
Fallen but still greedy, they return.&lt;br&gt;
What had to be done has been done,&lt;br&gt;
What had to be enjoyed has been enjoyed,&lt;br&gt;
Happiness has been realised through happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arose from the one named after a tree,&lt;br&gt;
I was born of the one whose banner shines.&lt;br&gt;
The banner killer has destroyed the great banner,&lt;br&gt;
By means of the banner itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccha has tossed away&lt;br&gt;
What he built over many years.&lt;br&gt;
Sitting comfortably, uplifted with joy,&lt;br&gt;
He teaches this to householders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He counselled me, the great hero,
The one who has gone beyond all things.
When I heard his teaching
I stayed close by him, mindful.
I’ve attained the three knowledges
And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My defilements have been burnt away&lt;br&gt;
By practising jhāna;&lt;br&gt;
Rebirth into all states of existence is over,&lt;br&gt;
Transmigraton through births is finished,&lt;br&gt;
Now there is no more rebirth&lt;br&gt;
Into any state of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sage with higher consciousness, heedful,&lt;br&gt;
Training in the ways of silence,&lt;br&gt;
At peace and always mindful:&lt;br&gt;
Such a one has no sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing the sweet Dhamma taught by the master,&lt;br&gt;
Who understands all, and whose knowledge excels,&lt;br&gt;
I’ve entered the path to realise the deathless.&lt;br&gt;
He’s skilled in the road to safety from the yoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtue is the highest here,&lt;br&gt;
But understanding is supreme.&lt;br&gt;
A person with both virtue and understanding&lt;br&gt;
Is victorious among men and gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though nibbāna is very refined and subtle,&lt;br&gt;
It is not difficult to realize for one who sees the goal,&lt;br&gt;
Skilled in thought, humble in manner,&lt;br&gt;
Cultivating the virtuous conduct of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;

When the point is grown and it’s become woody;&lt;br&gt;
That’s how I feel with the wife&lt;br&gt;
Who was arranged for me.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing an old person,&lt;br&gt;
One suffering from disease,&lt;br&gt;
And a corpse, come to the end of life,&lt;br&gt;
I went forth, becoming a wanderer,&lt;br&gt;
And abandoning the pleasures of the senses.&lt;/p&gt;

Dullness and drowsiness,&lt;br&gt;
Restlessness, and doubt&lt;br&gt;

That is signless and empty:&lt;br&gt;
Their track is hard to trace,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Commentary --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age[^1] at Sāvatthī, in a very wealthy clan of brahmins, he was named Koṭṭhita.[^2] When he was come of age he had learned the three Vedas, and perfected himself in the accomplishments of a brahmin. He heard the Master preach the Norm, found faith, and entered the Order. Practising insight from the day of his ordination he attained arahantship, together with thorough mastery of the form and meaning of the Norm.[^3] As proficient [7] herein he used to question the great Theras and Him-of-the-Ten-Powers[^4] about them. Hence it came that he was held chief of those who were thus proficient. Then the Master, having shown his attainments in the Vedalla-Sutta, ranked him chief of those who were proficient in insight.[^5]&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.2 Koṭṭhita the Great</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.2-commentary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.2-commentary/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="koṭṭhita-the-great"&gt;Koṭṭhita the Great&lt;a class="anchor" href="#ko%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adhita-the-great"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

And walk meditation alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>10.2 Ekavihāriya—“Dwelling Alone”</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-ten/thag10.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-ten/thag10.2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="102-ekavihāriyadwelling-alone"&gt;10.2 Ekavihāriya—“Dwelling Alone”&lt;a class="anchor" href="#102-ekavih%c4%81riyadwelling-alone"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, in front or behind,&lt;br&gt;
there is no one else,&lt;br&gt;
it’s extremely pleasant&lt;br&gt;
for one staying alone&lt;br&gt;
in the forest.&lt;br&gt;
Come then! Alone&lt;br&gt;
I will go to the wilderness&lt;br&gt;
praised by the Awakened One&lt;br&gt;
pleasant for a resolute monk&lt;br&gt;
dwelling alone.&lt;br&gt;
Alone,&lt;br&gt;
astute in my goal,&lt;br&gt;
I’ll quickly enter the grove&lt;br&gt;
—refreshing,&lt;br&gt;
giving rapture&lt;br&gt;
to meditators—&lt;br&gt;
the haunt&lt;br&gt;
of elephants in rut.&lt;br&gt;
When the Cool Forest’s in full flower,&lt;br&gt;
in a cool mountain gorge,&lt;br&gt;
having bathed my limbs&lt;br&gt;
I’ll walk back &amp;amp; forth&lt;br&gt;
alone.&lt;br&gt;
Ah, when will I dwell,&lt;br&gt;
alone and free from companions,&lt;br&gt;
in the refreshing great forest—&lt;br&gt;
my task done,&lt;br&gt;
effluent-free?&lt;br&gt;
As I desire to do this,&lt;br&gt;
may my purpose succeed.&lt;br&gt;
I myself&lt;br&gt;
will bring it about.&lt;br&gt;
No one can do it&lt;br&gt;
for anyone else.&lt;br&gt;
* * *
I myself&lt;br&gt;
bind on my armor.&lt;br&gt;
I will enter the grove&lt;br&gt;
and will not emerge&lt;br&gt;
without having attained&lt;br&gt;
the end of the effluents.&lt;br&gt;
While soft breezes blow—&lt;br&gt;
cool,&lt;br&gt;
heavily, fragrantly scented—&lt;br&gt;
I’ll make ignorance burst,&lt;br&gt;
as I sit on a mountaintop.&lt;br&gt;
In the forest covered with blossoms&lt;br&gt;
or perhaps on a cool hillside,&lt;br&gt;
blessed with the bliss of release,&lt;br&gt;
on Giribbaja I’ll delight.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* * *
I am now he&lt;br&gt;
whose resolves are fulfilled&lt;br&gt;
like the moon on a full-moon night.&lt;br&gt;
With effluents all&lt;br&gt;
totally ended,&lt;br&gt;
there is now no further becoming.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>12.2 Sunīta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-twelve/thag12.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-twelve/thag12.2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="122-sunīta"&gt;12.2 Sunīta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#122-sun%c4%abta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in a low-class family,&lt;br&gt;
Poor, with little to eat.&lt;br&gt;
My job was lowly—&lt;br&gt;
I threw out the old flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shunned by people,&lt;br&gt;
I was disregarded and treated with contempt.&lt;br&gt;
I humbled my heart,&lt;br&gt;
And paid respects to many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw the Buddha,&lt;br&gt;
Honoured by the Saṅgha of monks,&lt;br&gt;
The great hero,&lt;br&gt;
Entering the capital city of Magadhā.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped my carrying-pole&lt;br&gt;
And approached to pay respects.&lt;br&gt;
Out of compassion for me,&lt;br&gt;
The supreme man stood still.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>12.2 Sunīta the Outcaste</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-twelve/thag12.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-twelve/thag12.2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="122-sunīta-the-outcaste"&gt;12.2 Sunīta the Outcaste&lt;a class="anchor" href="#122-sun%c4%abta-the-outcaste"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into a lowly family I was born,&lt;br&gt;
poor, with next to no food.&lt;br&gt;
My work was degrading:&lt;br&gt;
I gathered the spoiled,&lt;br&gt;
the withered flowers from shrines&lt;br&gt;
and threw them away.&lt;br&gt;
People found me disgusting,&lt;br&gt;
despised me, disparaged me.&lt;br&gt;
Lowering my heart,&lt;br&gt;
I showed reverence to many.&lt;br&gt;
Then I saw the One Self-awakened,&lt;br&gt;
arrayed with a squadron of monks,&lt;br&gt;
the Great Hero, entering the city,&lt;br&gt;
supreme, of the Magadhans.&lt;br&gt;
Throwing down my carrying pole,&lt;br&gt;
I approached him to do reverence.&lt;br&gt;
He—the supreme man—stood still&lt;br&gt;
out of sympathy&lt;br&gt;
just&lt;br&gt;
for me.&lt;br&gt;
After paying homage&lt;br&gt;
to the feet of the teacher,&lt;br&gt;
I stood to one side&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; requested the Going Forth from him,&lt;br&gt;
supreme among all living beings.&lt;br&gt;
The compassionate Teacher,&lt;br&gt;
sympathetic to all the world, said:&lt;br&gt;
“Come, monk.”&lt;br&gt;
That was my formal Acceptance.&lt;br&gt;
Alone, I stayed in the wilds,&lt;br&gt;
untiring,&lt;br&gt;
I followed the Teacher’s words,&lt;br&gt;
just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.&lt;br&gt;
In the first watch of the night,&lt;br&gt;
I recollected previous lives;&lt;br&gt;
in the middle watch,&lt;br&gt;
purified the divine eye;&lt;br&gt;
in the last,&lt;br&gt;
burst the mass of darkness.&lt;br&gt;
Then, as night was ending&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; the sun returning,&lt;br&gt;
Indra &amp;amp; Brahmā came to pay homage to me,&lt;br&gt;
hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:&lt;br&gt;
“Homage to you,&lt;br&gt;
O thoroughbred of men,&lt;br&gt;
Homage to you,&lt;br&gt;
O man supreme,&lt;br&gt;
whose effluents are ended.&lt;br&gt;
You, dear sir,&lt;br&gt;
are worthy of offerings.”&lt;br&gt;
Seeing me,&lt;br&gt;
arrayed with a squadron of devas,&lt;br&gt;
the Teacher smiled &amp;amp; said:&lt;br&gt;
“Through austerity, celibacy,&lt;br&gt;
restraint, &amp;amp; self-control:&lt;br&gt;
That’s how one is a brahman.&lt;br&gt;
He is a brahman supreme.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>14.2 Godatta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-fourteen/thag14.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-fourteen/thag14.2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="142-godatta"&gt;14.2 Godatta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#142-godatta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a fine thoroughbred,&lt;br&gt;
Yoked to a carriage, endures the load,&lt;br&gt;
Oppressed by the heavy burden,&lt;br&gt;
And yet doesn’t try to escape the yoke;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So too, those who are as filled with understanding&lt;br&gt;
As the ocean is with water,&lt;br&gt;
Don’t look down on others;&lt;br&gt;
This is the noble Dhamma regarding living beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who fall under the dominion of time,&lt;br&gt;
Under the dominion of being reborn&lt;br&gt;
In one state of existence after another,&lt;br&gt;
Undergo suffering,&lt;br&gt;
And those young men grieve in this life.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>14.2 Godatta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-fourteen/thag14.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-fourteen/thag14.2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="142-godatta"&gt;14.2 Godatta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#142-godatta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a fine, well-bred bull&lt;br&gt;
yoked to a load,&lt;br&gt;
enduring his load,&lt;br&gt;
crushed&lt;br&gt;
by the heavy burden,&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t throw down his yoke;&lt;br&gt;
so, too, those who are filled with discernment&lt;br&gt;
—as the ocean, with water—&lt;br&gt;
don’t look down on others.&lt;br&gt;
This is nobility among beings.&lt;br&gt;
Having fallen in time&lt;br&gt;
under the sway of time,&lt;br&gt;
having come under the sway&lt;br&gt;
of becoming &amp;amp; not-,&lt;br&gt;
people fall subject to pain&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; they grieve.&lt;br&gt;
Elated by causes of pleasure,&lt;br&gt;
cast down by causes of pain,&lt;br&gt;
fools are destroyed&lt;br&gt;
by both,&lt;br&gt;
not seeing them&lt;br&gt;
for what they are.&lt;br&gt;
While those who, in the midst of&lt;br&gt;
pleasure &amp;amp; pain&lt;br&gt;
have gone past the seamstress—craving—,&lt;br&gt;
stand firm&lt;br&gt;
like a boundary pillar,&lt;br&gt;
neither elated nor cast down.&lt;br&gt;
Not to gain or loss&lt;br&gt;
not to status or honor,&lt;br&gt;
not to praise or blame,&lt;br&gt;
not to pleasure or pain:&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere&lt;br&gt;
they do not adhere—&lt;br&gt;
like a water bead&lt;br&gt;
on a lotus.&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere&lt;br&gt;
they are happy, the enlightened,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
everywhere&lt;br&gt;
un-&lt;br&gt;
defeated.&lt;br&gt;
No matter what&lt;br&gt;
the unrighteous gain&lt;br&gt;
or the righteous loss,&lt;br&gt;
righteous loss is better&lt;br&gt;
than if there were unrighteous gain.&lt;br&gt;
No matter what&lt;br&gt;
the status of the unaware&lt;br&gt;
or the lowliness of those who know,&lt;br&gt;
the lowliness of those who know&lt;br&gt;
is better,&lt;br&gt;
not the status of those&lt;br&gt;
unaware.&lt;br&gt;
No matter what&lt;br&gt;
the praise from fools&lt;br&gt;
or the censure from those who know,&lt;br&gt;
the censure from those who know&lt;br&gt;
is better&lt;br&gt;
than if there were praise&lt;br&gt;
from fools.&lt;br&gt;
And as for the pleasure&lt;br&gt;
from sensuality&lt;br&gt;

the pain from seclusion&lt;br&gt;
is better&lt;br&gt;

from sensuality.&lt;br&gt;
And as for living through unrighteousness&lt;br&gt;
and dying for righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
dying for righteousness&lt;br&gt;
is better,&lt;br&gt;
than if one were to live&lt;br&gt;
through unrighteousness.&lt;br&gt;
Those who’ve abandoned&lt;br&gt;
sensuality &amp;amp; anger,&lt;br&gt;
whose minds are calmed&lt;br&gt;
from becoming &amp;amp; non-,&lt;br&gt;
go through the world&lt;br&gt;
unattached.&lt;br&gt;
For them there is nothing&lt;br&gt;
dear or undear.&lt;br&gt;
Developing&lt;br&gt;
the factors for awakening,&lt;br&gt;

And escaped from entanglements,&lt;br&gt;
Delighting in the renunciation of sensual pleasures,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human being, self-awakened,&lt;br&gt;
his mind tamed, concentrated,&lt;br&gt;
traveling along the Brahmā road,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the stilling of the mind:&lt;br&gt;
He, having gone beyond all dhammas,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
to whom human beings pay homage,&lt;br&gt;
the devas pay homage as well—&lt;br&gt;
so I have heard from the Worthy One&lt;br&gt;
—to him, gone past all fetters,&lt;br&gt;
gone from the forest to the clearing,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the renunciation of sensuality,&lt;br&gt;
released like gold from its ore.&lt;br&gt;
He, the nāga outshining all others,&lt;br&gt;
as the Himalayas, rocky hills:&lt;br&gt;
Among all things named nāga,&lt;br&gt;
he, unexcelled, is truly named.&lt;br&gt;
I will praise the nāga to you—&lt;br&gt;
for he does no misdeed.&lt;br&gt;
Composure &amp;amp; harmlessness&lt;br&gt;
are the nāga’s two feet.&lt;br&gt;
Austerity &amp;amp; celibacy&lt;br&gt;
are the nāga’s two other feet.&lt;br&gt;
Conviction is the great nāga’s trunk,&lt;br&gt;
his hand;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Mindfulness his neck; his head:&lt;br&gt;
discernment,&lt;br&gt;
discrimination,&lt;br&gt;
reflection on dhammas;&lt;br&gt;

Everywhere he’s restrained, the nāga:&lt;br&gt;

He eats what is blameless;&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t eat what is not;&lt;br&gt;

well-born in the world, lives in the world,&lt;br&gt;

in his conduct, his mindfulness,&lt;br&gt;
alone, content:&lt;br&gt;
He’s called a monk.&lt;br&gt;
Eating moist or dry food,&lt;br&gt;
he shouldn’t be heavily sated.&lt;br&gt;
With unfilled belly, with measured food,&lt;br&gt;
the monk should wander&lt;br&gt;
mindfully.&lt;br&gt;
Leaving four or five mouthfuls uneaten,&lt;br&gt;
he should drink water:&lt;br&gt;
This is enough&lt;br&gt;
for the easeful abiding&lt;br&gt;
of a resolute monk.&lt;br&gt;
And he covers himself with a proper robe&lt;br&gt;
enough for that purpose:&lt;br&gt;
This is enough&lt;br&gt;
for the easeful abiding&lt;br&gt;
of a resolute monk.&lt;br&gt;
As he sits cross-legged,&lt;br&gt;
it doesn’t rain on his knees:&lt;br&gt;
This is enough&lt;br&gt;

Whoever sees pleasure as pain,&lt;br&gt;

and that there’s nothing between the two:&lt;br&gt;
With what will he be what in the world?&lt;br&gt;
“May I never have anything to do&lt;br&gt;
with a person of evil desires,&lt;br&gt;
lazy, lowly in his persistence,&lt;br&gt;

With what will he be what in the world?&lt;br&gt;
But one who is learned, wise,&lt;br&gt;

One who is devoted to objectification,&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But whoever, abandoning objectification,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the path of non-objectification,&lt;br&gt;
attains unbinding,&lt;br&gt;
the unexcelled rest from the yoke.&lt;br&gt;
In village or wilds,&lt;br&gt;
valley, plateau:&lt;br&gt;
that place is delightful&lt;br&gt;
where arahants dwell.&lt;br&gt;
Delightful wilds&lt;br&gt;
where the crowds don’t delight,&lt;br&gt;
those free from passion&lt;br&gt;
delight,&lt;br&gt;

For the one who stays&lt;br&gt;

to the bad, he’s not.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He, the Blessed One, the One&lt;br&gt;
Awakened, the One with Eyes,&lt;br&gt;
was teaching Dhamma to another.&lt;br&gt;
And while the Dhamma was being taught,&lt;br&gt;
I, desiring the Dhamma,&lt;br&gt;
turned an attentive ear.&lt;br&gt;
My listening was not in vain:&lt;br&gt;
I’m released, effluent-free.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not for knowledge of previous lifetimes,&lt;br&gt;
nor for the divine eye,&lt;br&gt;
nor for knowledge of others’ minds,&lt;br&gt;
nor for psychic power,&lt;br&gt;
nor for knowledge of beings dying &amp;amp; being reborn,&lt;br&gt;
nor for purifying the divine ear&lt;br&gt;
did I have any aspiration.&lt;br&gt;
Sitting at the root of a tree,&lt;br&gt;
with shaven head,&lt;br&gt;
wrapped in an outer robe,&lt;br&gt;
the elder foremost in discernment:&lt;br&gt;
Upatissa does jhāna.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Attaining no-thinking,&lt;br&gt;
the disciple of the Rightly&lt;br&gt;
Self-Awakened One&lt;br&gt;
is endowed with noble silence&lt;br&gt;
straightaway.&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a mountain of rock&lt;br&gt;
is unwavering, well-settled,&lt;br&gt;
so a monk whose delusion is ended&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t quiver—&lt;br&gt;
just like a mountain.&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To a person without blemish,&lt;br&gt;
in constant quest of what’s pure,&lt;br&gt;
a hair-tip of evil&lt;br&gt;
seems a storm cloud.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time&lt;br&gt;
like a worker his wage.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time,&lt;br&gt;
mindful, alert.&lt;br&gt;
On either side is death,&lt;br&gt;
it’s not non-death, ahead or behind.&lt;br&gt;
Practice, don’t perish.&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let the moment pass you by.&lt;br&gt;
As a frontier fortress is guarded&lt;br&gt;
within &amp;amp; without,&lt;br&gt;
you should safeguard yourselves.&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let the moment&lt;br&gt;
pass you by.&lt;br&gt;
Those for whom the moment is past&lt;br&gt;
grieve, consigned to hell.&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Calmed, restrained,&lt;br&gt;
giving counsel unruffled,&lt;br&gt;
he shakes off evil qualities—&lt;br&gt;
as the breeze,&lt;br&gt;
a leaf from a tree.&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Calmed, restrained,&lt;br&gt;
giving counsel unruffled,&lt;br&gt;
he removed evil qualities—&lt;br&gt;
as the breeze,&lt;br&gt;
a leaf from a tree.&lt;br&gt;
You shouldn’t trust in this way&lt;br&gt;
some householders or those gone forth.&lt;br&gt;
Having been good, they become bad.&lt;br&gt;
Having been bad, they become good.&lt;br&gt;
Sensual desire, ill will,&lt;br&gt;
sloth &amp;amp; torpor,&lt;br&gt;
restlessness &amp;amp; uncertainty:&lt;br&gt;
These, for a monk, are the five defilements.&lt;br&gt;
The concentration of one&lt;br&gt;
dwelling in heedfulness&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t waver,&lt;br&gt;
whether he is honored or not.&lt;br&gt;
Doing jhāna, persevering,&lt;br&gt;
having&lt;br&gt;
subtle insight into&lt;br&gt;
subtle views,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the ending of clinging:&lt;br&gt;
He’s called a man of integrity.&lt;br&gt;
The great ocean, the Earth,&lt;br&gt;
a mountain, even the wind&lt;br&gt;
aren’t fitting as a comparison&lt;br&gt;
for the Teacher’s foremost release.&lt;br&gt;
Keeping the (Dhamma) wheel going,&lt;br&gt;
the elder of great knowledge, centered,&lt;br&gt;
being like earth, fire, &amp;amp; water,&lt;br&gt;
is neither impassioned nor angered.&lt;sup id="fnref:11"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Having attained perfection in discernment,&lt;sup id="fnref:12"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
greatly intelligent, a great sage,&lt;br&gt;
not dull, though seemingly dull,&lt;br&gt;
he always wanders unbound.&lt;br&gt;
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done;&lt;br&gt;
the heavy load, laid down;&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming, uprooted.&lt;br&gt;
Attain consummation&lt;br&gt;
through heedfulness:&lt;br&gt;
That is my message.&lt;br&gt;
So then, I’m about to&lt;br&gt;
unbind.&lt;br&gt;
I’m released&lt;br&gt;
everywhere.&lt;sup id="fnref:13"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>17.2 Sāriputta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-seventeen/thag17.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-seventeen/thag17.2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="172-sāriputta"&gt;17.2 Sāriputta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#172-s%c4%81riputta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Or like one who is peaceful;&lt;br&gt;
A heedful person is like one of good intentions,&lt;br&gt;
Who is practicing jhāna;&lt;br&gt;
Happy inside, possessing samādhi,&lt;br&gt;
Solitary, contented; that is what they call a monk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When eating fresh or dried food,&lt;br&gt;
One shouldn’t be overly satisfied.&lt;br&gt;
A monk should wander mindfully,&lt;br&gt;
With unfilled belly, taking limited food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four or five mouthfuls before you’re full,&lt;br&gt;
Drink some water;&lt;br&gt;
This is enough to live comfortably&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t live by fasting,&lt;br&gt;
But food doesn’t lead to peace of heart.&lt;br&gt;
Seeing how the body is sustained by food,&lt;br&gt;
I wander, seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know it’s a swamp,&lt;br&gt;
This worship and homage from respectable families;&lt;br&gt;
A subtle dart, hard to pull out;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went forth five days ago,&lt;br&gt;
A trainee, with my heart’s goal unfulfilled.&lt;br&gt;
I entered my dwelling,&lt;br&gt;
And an aspiration arose in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t eat; I won’t drink;&lt;br&gt;
I won’t leave my dwelling;&lt;br&gt;
Nor will I lie down on my side—&lt;br&gt;
Until the dart of craving is pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my energy and effort&lt;br&gt;
As I practice this way!&lt;br&gt;
I’ve attained the three knowledges,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by drowsiness,&lt;br&gt;
I came out of my dwelling;&lt;br&gt;
Stepping up on to the walking meditation path,&lt;br&gt;
I fell to the ground right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rubbed my limbs, and again&lt;br&gt;
I stepped up on to the walking meditation path.&lt;br&gt;
I walked meditation up and down the path,&lt;br&gt;
Serene inside myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the realization&lt;br&gt;
Came upon me—&lt;br&gt;
The danger became clear,&lt;br&gt;
And I was firmly repulsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my mind was liberated—&lt;br&gt;

Rubbing my limbs,&lt;br&gt;
I got up on the path again.&lt;br&gt;
Walking back &amp;amp; forth on the path,&lt;br&gt;
I became well-centered within.&lt;br&gt;
Apt attention arose in me,&lt;br&gt;
the drawbacks appeared,&lt;br&gt;
disenchantment stood&lt;br&gt;
at an even keel:&lt;br&gt;
With that, my heart was released.&lt;br&gt;
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re prepared for the future,&lt;br&gt;
Both the good and the bad,&lt;br&gt;
Then those who look for your weakness,&lt;br&gt;
Whether enemies or well-wishers, will find none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One who has fulfilled, developed,&lt;br&gt;
And gradually consolidated&lt;br&gt;
Mindfulness of breathing&lt;br&gt;
As taught by the Buddha:&lt;br&gt;
They light up the world,&lt;br&gt;
Like the moon freed from a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, my mind is clean,&lt;br&gt;
Measureless, and well-developed;&lt;br&gt;
It is broken through and uplifted—&lt;br&gt;
It radiates in every direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>16.3 Telakāni</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-sixteen/thag16.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-sixteen/thag16.3/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="163-telakāni"&gt;16.3 Telakāni&lt;a class="anchor" href="#163-telak%c4%81ni"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, unfortunately,&lt;br&gt;
Though I ardently contemplated the Dhamma,&lt;br&gt;
I didn’t have peace of mind;&lt;br&gt;
So I asked ascetics and holy men:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who has crossed over the world?&lt;br&gt;
Whose attainment culminates in the deathless?&lt;br&gt;
Whose teaching do I accept,&lt;br&gt;
To understand the highest goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hooked inside,&lt;br&gt;
Like a fish swallowing bait;&lt;br&gt;
Bound like the demon Vepaciti&lt;br&gt;
In Mahinda’s trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragging it along, I’m not freed&lt;br&gt;
From grief and lamentation.&lt;br&gt;
Who will free me from bonds in the world,&lt;br&gt;
So that I may know awakening?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>17.3 Ānanda</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-seventeen/thag17.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-seventeen/thag17.3/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="173-ānanda"&gt;17.3 Ānanda&lt;a class="anchor" href="#173-%c4%81nanda"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

They’ve lost the causes for happiness,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an only child,&lt;br&gt;
Loved by my mother and father.&lt;br&gt;
They had me by practising&lt;br&gt;
Many prayers and observances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of compassion,&lt;br&gt;
Wishing me well and seeking my welfare,&lt;br&gt;
My mother and father&lt;br&gt;
Took me up to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had this son with difficulty;&lt;br&gt;
He is delicate, and has grown up in comfort.&lt;br&gt;
We offer him to you, Lord,&lt;br&gt;
To attend upon the conqueror.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher, having accepted me,&lt;br&gt;

Who was free of fear from any direction,&lt;br&gt;
I was struck with awe,&lt;br&gt;
Since I’d seen the best of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the good luck&lt;br&gt;
To find such a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
But you push it all away,&lt;br&gt;
You’ll lose your chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too cold,
too hot,
too late in the evening—
people who say this,
shirking their work:
The moment passes them by.
Whoever regards cold &amp;amp; heat
as no more than grass,
doing his manly duties,
won’t fall away
from ease.
With my chest
I push through wild grasses—
spear-grass,
ribbon-grass,
rushes—

the man of undaunted heart.
Touched by gnats
&amp;amp; horseflies
in the wilds,
the great wood,
like an elephant
at the head of a battle:
He, mindful,
should stay there,
endure.
One alone is like Brahmā,
two, like devas,
three, like a village,
more than that:
a hullabaloo.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Verse 3</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.3/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="13-kaṅkhā-doubting-revata"&gt;1.3 Kaṅkhā (Doubting) Revata&lt;a class="anchor" href="#13-ka%e1%b9%85kh%c4%81-doubting-revata"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in the days of our Exalted One, in an eminent brahmin clan, at the brahmin village of Donavatthu, not far from Kapilavatthu. He was sister&amp;rsquo;s son of the Elder Kondañña,[1] and was named Puṇṇa. And after performing all the duties of his novitiate, he put forth every effort till he had accomplished the highest duties of a recluse. He thereupon went with his uncle to dwell near the Master, leaving the neighbourhood of Kapilavatthu.

He was sister&amp;rsquo;s son of the Elder Kondañña, &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and was named Puṇṇa. And after performing all the duties of his novitiate, he put forth every effort till he had accomplished the highest duties of a recluse. He thereupon went with his uncle to dwell near the Master, leaving the neighbourhood of Kapilavatthu. And thoroughly intent in practice, he not long after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.4 Puṇṇa of the Mantānis</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.4/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="14-puṇṇa-of-the-mantānis"&gt;1.4 Puṇṇa of the Mantānis&lt;a class="anchor" href="#14-pu%e1%b9%87%e1%b9%87a-of-the-mant%c4%81nis"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

I was despised in the past;&lt;br&gt;
My brother turned me away,&lt;br&gt;
Saying, “Go home now”.&lt;/p&gt;

Look at the image beautified,
a heap of festering wounds, shored up:
ill, but the object
of many resolves,
where there is nothing
lasting or sure.1
Look at the form beautified
with earrings &amp;amp; gems:
a skeleton wrapped in skin,
made attractive with clothes.
Feet reddened with henna,
a face smeared with powder:
enough to deceive a fool,
but not a seeker for the further shore.
Hair plaited in eight pleats,
eyes smeared with unguent:
enough to deceive a fool,
but not a seeker for the further shore.
Like a newly painted unguent pot—
a putrid body adorned:
enough to deceive a fool,
but not a seeker for the further shore.
The hunter set out the snares,
but the deer didn’t go near the trap.
Having eaten the bait,
we go,
leaving the hunters
to weep.
The hunter’s snares are broken;
the deer didn’t go near the trap.
Having eaten the bait,
we go,
leaving the hunters
to grieve.2&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>16.4 Raṭṭhapāla</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-sixteen/thag16.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-sixteen/thag16.4/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="164-raṭṭhapāla"&gt;16.4 Raṭṭhapāla&lt;a class="anchor" href="#164-ra%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adhap%c4%81la"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the spring festival at Gayā,&lt;br&gt;
It was so welcome for me&lt;br&gt;
To see the Buddha,&lt;br&gt;
Teaching the supreme Dhamma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was glorious, the teacher of a community,&lt;br&gt;
Who had realised the highest, a leader,&lt;br&gt;
Conqueror of the world with its gods;&lt;br&gt;
His vision was unequalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great being of power, a great hero,&lt;br&gt;
A great light, without defilements.&lt;br&gt;
With the utter ending of all defilements,&lt;br&gt;
The teacher has no fear from any direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>5.6 Nadīkassapa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-five/thag5.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-five/thag5.6/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="56-nadīkassapa"&gt;5.6 Nadīkassapa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#56-nad%c4%abkassapa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was truly for my benefit&lt;br&gt;
That the Buddha went to the river Nerañjara;&lt;br&gt;
When I heard his teaching,&lt;br&gt;
I rejected wrong view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I performed the higher&lt;br&gt;
And lower sacrifices;&lt;br&gt;
I worshipped the sacred flame,&lt;br&gt;
Thinking, “This is purity.”&lt;br&gt;
I was a blind, unenlightened person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caught in the thicket of wrong view,&lt;br&gt;
Deluded by misapprehension;&lt;br&gt;
Thinking impurity was purity,&lt;br&gt;
I was blind and ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve abandoned wrong view,&lt;br&gt;
Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,&lt;br&gt;
I worship what is truly worthy of offerings:&lt;br&gt;
I bow to the Tathāgata.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>6.6 Sappadāsa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-six/thag6.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-six/thag6.6/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="66-sappadāsa"&gt;6.6 Sappadāsa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#66-sappad%c4%81sa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty five years since my going forth,&lt;br&gt;
and no peace of awareness&lt;br&gt;
—not a finger-snap’s worth—&lt;br&gt;
attained.&lt;br&gt;
Having gained no oneness of mind,&lt;br&gt;
I was wracked with lust.&lt;br&gt;
Wailing, with my arms upheld,&lt;br&gt;
I ran amok from my dwelling—&lt;br&gt;
“Or… or shall I take the knife?&lt;br&gt;
What’s the use of life to me?&lt;br&gt;
If I were to renounce the training,&lt;br&gt;
what sort of death would I have?”&lt;br&gt;
So, taking a razor,&lt;br&gt;
I sat down on a bed.&lt;br&gt;
And there was the razor,&lt;br&gt;
placed ready to cut my own vein,&lt;br&gt;
when apt attention arose in me,&lt;br&gt;
the drawbacks appeared,&lt;br&gt;
disenchantment stood&lt;br&gt;
at an even keel:&lt;br&gt;
With that, my heart was released.&lt;br&gt;
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!&lt;br&gt;
The three knowledges&lt;br&gt;
have been attained;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chapter Six</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-six/chapter-six/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-six/chapter-six/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="chapter-six"&gt;Chapter Six&lt;a class="anchor" href="#chapter-six"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the marvels&lt;br&gt;
Of the renowned Gotama,&lt;br&gt;
I didn’t immediately bow to him;&lt;br&gt;
I was blinded by jealousy and conceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what I was thinking,&lt;br&gt;
The trainer of men spurred me on;&lt;br&gt;
And I was struck with a marvellous inspiration,&lt;br&gt;
That gave me goose-bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejecting my petty accomplishments&lt;br&gt;
When I used to be a matted-hair ascetic,&lt;br&gt;
I then went forth,&lt;br&gt;
In the conqueror’s teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chapter Six</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-six/chapter-six/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-six/chapter-six/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="chapter-six"&gt;Chapter Six&lt;a class="anchor" href="#chapter-six"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Who harms other creatures:&lt;br&gt;
From this world and the next,&lt;br&gt;
That person will fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But someone with a mind of loving-kindness,&lt;br&gt;
Compassionate for all creatures:&lt;br&gt;
That sort of person&lt;br&gt;
Gives rise to merit in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

In attending closely to ascetics,&lt;br&gt;
In sitting alone in hidden places,&lt;br&gt;

Morning, midday, and evening—&lt;br&gt;

For the Gayā spring festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever bad things I’ve done&lt;br&gt;

This is the view I previously held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ornamented, finely clothed,&lt;br&gt;
garlanded, adorned,&lt;br&gt;
her feet stained red with lac,&lt;br&gt;
she wore slippers:&lt;br&gt;
a courtesan.&lt;br&gt;
Stepping out of her slippers—&lt;br&gt;
her hands raised before me,&lt;br&gt;
palm-to-palm over her heart—&lt;br&gt;
she softly, tenderly,&lt;br&gt;
in measured words&lt;br&gt;
spoke to me first:&lt;br&gt;
“You are young, recluse.&lt;br&gt;

Partake of human sensuality.&lt;br&gt;
I will give you luxury.&lt;br&gt;
Truly I vow to you,&lt;br&gt;
I will tend to you as to a fire.&lt;br&gt;
When we are old,&lt;br&gt;
both leaning on canes,&lt;br&gt;
then we will both become recluses,&lt;br&gt;
winning the benefits of both worlds.”&lt;br&gt;
And seeing her before me—&lt;br&gt;
a courtesan, ornamented, finely clothed,&lt;br&gt;
hands palm-to-palm over her heart—&lt;br&gt;
like a snare of death laid out,&lt;br&gt;
apt attention arose in me,&lt;br&gt;
the drawbacks appeared,&lt;br&gt;
disenchantment stood&lt;br&gt;
at an even keel:&lt;br&gt;
With that, my heart was released.&lt;br&gt;
See the Dhamma’s true rightness!&lt;br&gt;

But you say ‘I’m standing still’;&lt;br&gt;
And I’m standing still, but you tell me I’m not.&lt;br&gt;
I’m asking you this, ascetic:&lt;br&gt;
Why are you standing still and I’m not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aṅgulimāla, I always stand still—&lt;br&gt;
I’ve given up violence towards all living beings.&lt;br&gt;
But you have no restraint towards living creatures;&lt;br&gt;
That’s why I’m standing still and you’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a been a long time since an ascetic,&lt;br&gt;
A great sage who I honour,&lt;br&gt;
Has entered this great forest.&lt;br&gt;
Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aṅgulimāla:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“While walking, contemplative,&lt;br&gt;
you say, ’I have stopped.’&lt;br&gt;
But when I have stopped&lt;br&gt;
you say that I haven’t.&lt;br&gt;
I ask you the meaning of this:&lt;br&gt;
How have you stopped?&lt;br&gt;
How haven’t I?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Buddha:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“I have stopped, Aṅgulimāla,&lt;br&gt;
once &amp;amp; for all,&lt;br&gt;
having cast off violence&lt;br&gt;
toward all living beings.&lt;br&gt;
You, though,&lt;br&gt;
are unrestrained toward beings.&lt;br&gt;
That’s how I’ve stopped&lt;br&gt;
and you haven’t.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Aṅgulimāla:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“At long last a greatly revered great seer&lt;br&gt;
for my sake&lt;br&gt;
has come to the great forest.&lt;br&gt;
Having heard your verse&lt;br&gt;
in line with the Dhamma,&lt;br&gt;
I will go about&lt;br&gt;
having abandoned evil.”&lt;br&gt;
So saying, the bandit&lt;br&gt;
hurled his sword &amp;amp; weapons&lt;br&gt;
over a cliff&lt;br&gt;
into a chasm,&lt;br&gt;
a pit.&lt;br&gt;
Then the bandit paid homage&lt;br&gt;
to the feet of the One Well-Gone,&lt;br&gt;
and right there requested the Going-forth.&lt;br&gt;
The Awakened One,&lt;br&gt;
the compassionate great seer,&lt;br&gt;
the teacher of the world, along with its devas,&lt;br&gt;
said to him then:&lt;br&gt;
“Come, monk.”&lt;br&gt;
That in itself&lt;br&gt;
was monkhood for him.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
Aṅgulimāla:&lt;br&gt;
Who once was heedless,&lt;br&gt;
but later is not,&lt;br&gt;
brightens the world&lt;br&gt;
like the moon set free from a cloud.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His evil-done deed&lt;br&gt;
is replaced with skillfulness:&lt;br&gt;
He brightens the world&lt;br&gt;
like the moon set free from a cloud.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whatever young monk&lt;br&gt;
devotes himself&lt;br&gt;
to the Buddha’s bidding:&lt;br&gt;
He brightens the world&lt;br&gt;
like the moon set free from a cloud.&lt;br&gt;
May even my enemies&lt;br&gt;
hear talk of the Dhamma.&lt;br&gt;
May even my enemies&lt;br&gt;
devote themselves&lt;br&gt;
to the Buddha’s bidding.&lt;br&gt;
May even my enemies&lt;br&gt;
associate with those people&lt;br&gt;
who—peaceful, good—&lt;br&gt;
get others to accept the Dhamma.&lt;br&gt;
May even my enemies&lt;br&gt;
hear the Dhamma time &amp;amp; again&lt;br&gt;
from those who advise endurance,&lt;br&gt;
forbearance,&lt;br&gt;
who praise non-opposition,&lt;br&gt;
and may they follow it.&lt;br&gt;
For surely he wouldn’t harm me,&lt;br&gt;
or anyone else;&lt;br&gt;
he would attain the foremost peace,&lt;br&gt;
would protect the feeble &amp;amp; firm.&lt;br&gt;
Irrigators guide the water.&lt;br&gt;
Fletchers shape the arrow shaft.&lt;br&gt;
Carpenters shape the wood.&lt;br&gt;

themselves.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some tame with a blunt stick,&lt;br&gt;
with hooks, &amp;amp; with whips&lt;br&gt;
But without blunt or bladed weapons&lt;br&gt;
I was tamed by the one who is Such.&lt;br&gt;
“Doer of No Harm” is my name,&lt;br&gt;
but I used to be a doer of harm.&lt;br&gt;
Today I am true to my name,&lt;br&gt;
for I harm no one at all.&lt;br&gt;
A bandit&lt;br&gt;
I used to be,&lt;br&gt;
renowned as Aṅgulimāla.&lt;br&gt;
Swept along by a great flood,&lt;br&gt;
I went to the Buddha as refuge.&lt;br&gt;
Bloody-handed&lt;br&gt;
I used to be,&lt;br&gt;
renowned as Aṅgulimāla.&lt;br&gt;
See my going for refuge!&lt;br&gt;
Uprooted is [craving],&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming.&lt;br&gt;
Having done the type of kamma&lt;br&gt;
that would lead to many&lt;br&gt;
bad destinations,&lt;br&gt;
touched by the fruit of [that] kamma,&lt;br&gt;
unindebted, I eat my food.&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
They’re addicted to heedlessness&lt;br&gt;
—dullards, fools—&lt;br&gt;
while one who is wise&lt;br&gt;
cherishes heedfulness&lt;br&gt;
as his highest wealth.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t give way to heedlessness&lt;br&gt;
or to intimacy&lt;br&gt;
with sensual delight—&lt;br&gt;
for a heedful person,&lt;br&gt;
absorbed in jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
attains an abundant bliss.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

it was not badly thought through for me.&lt;br&gt;
From among well-analyzed qualities,&lt;br&gt;
I have obtained&lt;br&gt;
the best.&lt;br&gt;
This has come well &amp;amp; not gone away,&lt;br&gt;
it was not badly thought through for me.&lt;br&gt;

Where once I stayed here &amp;amp; there&lt;br&gt;
with shuddering mind—&lt;br&gt;
in the wilderness,&lt;br&gt;
at the foot of a tree,&lt;br&gt;
in mountains,&lt;br&gt;
caves—&lt;br&gt;
with ease I now lie down, I stand,&lt;br&gt;
with ease I live my life.&lt;br&gt;
O, the Teacher has shown me sympathy!&lt;br&gt;
Before, I was of brahman stock,&lt;br&gt;
on either side high-born.&lt;br&gt;
Today I’m the son&lt;br&gt;

the Dhamma-king,&lt;br&gt;
the Teacher.&lt;br&gt;
Rid of craving, devoid of clinging,&lt;br&gt;
sense-doors guarded, well-restrained,&lt;br&gt;
having killed the root of evil,&lt;br&gt;
I’ve reached the end of the effluents.&lt;br&gt;
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;

supreme, foremost of charioteers,&lt;br&gt;

casting away pride &amp;amp; intoxication&lt;br&gt;
through an awareness serene &amp;amp; clear,&lt;br&gt;
I bowed down&lt;br&gt;
my&lt;br&gt;
head&lt;br&gt;
to him, supreme&lt;br&gt;
among all living beings.&lt;br&gt;
Haughtiness &amp;amp; contempt&lt;br&gt;
have been abandoned&lt;br&gt;
—rooted out—&lt;br&gt;
the conceit “I am” is extracted,&lt;br&gt;
all forms of pride, destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chapter Nine</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-nine/chapter-nine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-nine/chapter-nine/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="chapter-nine"&gt;Chapter Nine&lt;a class="anchor" href="#chapter-nine"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

When, in the sky, the thundercloud roars,&lt;br&gt;

When, seated on the bank of rivers&lt;br&gt;
covered with flowers,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening well increases learning.&lt;br&gt;
What is learned increases discernment.&lt;br&gt;
Through discernment one knows the goal.&lt;br&gt;
When known, the goal brings bliss.&lt;br&gt;
Stay in isolated lodgings;&lt;br&gt;

“May these beings&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whence is there anger&lt;br&gt;
in one without anger&lt;br&gt;
tamed, calmed, living in tune,&lt;br&gt;
released through right knowing,&lt;br&gt;
Such?&lt;br&gt;
You make things worse&lt;br&gt;
when you flare up&lt;br&gt;
at someone who’s angry.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever doesn’t flare up&lt;br&gt;
at someone who’s angry&lt;br&gt;
wins a battle&lt;br&gt;
hard to win.&lt;br&gt;
You live for the good of both&lt;br&gt;
—your own, the other’s—&lt;br&gt;
when, knowing the other’s provoked,&lt;br&gt;
you mindfully grow calm.&lt;br&gt;
When you work the cure of both&lt;br&gt;
—your own, the other’s—&lt;br&gt;
those who think you a fool&lt;br&gt;
know nothing of Dhamma.&lt;br&gt;
If anger arises,&lt;br&gt;
reflect on the saw simile.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If craving for savor,&lt;br&gt;

If your mind runs loose&lt;br&gt;
after sensual pleasures&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; states of becoming,&lt;br&gt;
quickly restrain it with mindfulness&lt;br&gt;
as you would a bad ox&lt;br&gt;
eating grain.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chapter Twelve</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-twelve/chapter-twelve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/sujato/chapter-twelve/chapter-twelve/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="chapter-twelve"&gt;Chapter Twelve&lt;a class="anchor" href="#chapter-twelve"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One should train just in virtue,&lt;br&gt;
For in this world, when virtue is&lt;br&gt;
Cultivated and well-trained,&lt;br&gt;
It provides all success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desiring three kinds of happiness—&lt;br&gt;
Praise, prosperity,&lt;br&gt;
And to delight in heaven after passing away—&lt;br&gt;
The wise should protect virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-behaved have many friends,&lt;br&gt;
Because of their self-restraint.&lt;br&gt;
But one without virtue, of bad conduct,&lt;br&gt;
Drives away their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person of bad behavior has&lt;br&gt;
Ill-repute and infamy.&lt;br&gt;
A person of virtue always has&lt;br&gt;
A good reputation, fame, and praise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chapter Twelve</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-twelve/chapter-twelve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-twelve/chapter-twelve/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="chapter-twelve"&gt;Chapter Twelve&lt;a class="anchor" href="#chapter-twelve"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here master the virtue&lt;br&gt;
that in this world is well-mastered,&lt;br&gt;
for virtue, when cultivated,&lt;br&gt;
brings every consummation near.&lt;br&gt;
Wise, one should protect one’s virtue,&lt;br&gt;
aspiring to three pleasures:&lt;br&gt;
praise, the gaining of wealth,&lt;br&gt;
and—after death—rejoicing in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
The virtuous one, through restraint,&lt;br&gt;
acquires many friends,&lt;br&gt;
while the unvirtuous one, practicing evil,&lt;br&gt;
from friends is estranged.&lt;br&gt;
The unvirtuous person gains&lt;br&gt;
disrepute &amp;amp; dishonor;&lt;br&gt;
the virtuous person, always,&lt;br&gt;
repute, honor, &amp;amp; praise.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue is the beginning, the establishing,&lt;br&gt;
the mother of what is fine,&lt;br&gt;
the foremost of all qualities:&lt;br&gt;
Therefore virtue should be purified.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue is also control, restraint,&lt;br&gt;
the delight of the mind,&lt;br&gt;
the ford of all Buddhas:&lt;br&gt;
Therefore virtue should be purified.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an incomparable strength.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the ultimate weapon.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the highest adornment.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an astounding coat of mail.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an imposing bridge.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: an unexcelled fragrance.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the highest fragrant ointment&lt;br&gt;
by which one wafts&lt;br&gt;
this direction &amp;amp; that.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the supreme provision.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the ultimate food for the journey.&lt;br&gt;
Virtue: the highest vehicle&lt;br&gt;
by which one goes&lt;br&gt;
this direction &amp;amp; that.&lt;br&gt;
Right here he gains blame,&lt;br&gt;
and after death, in deprivation,&lt;br&gt;
he’s unhappy at heart:&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere the fool&lt;br&gt;
is unhappy at heart,&lt;br&gt;
not concentrated on virtues.&lt;br&gt;
Right here he gains honor&lt;br&gt;
and after death, in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
is happy at heart:&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere the enlightened one&lt;br&gt;
is happy at heart,&lt;br&gt;
well-concentrated on virtues.&lt;br&gt;
Here virtue is supreme,&lt;br&gt;
but one with discernment is the ultimate.&lt;br&gt;
Among human beings &amp;amp; devas&lt;br&gt;
one conquers&lt;br&gt;
through virtue &amp;amp; discernment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.13</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.13/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="113-vanavaccha"&gt;1.13 Vanavaccha&lt;a class="anchor" href="#113-vanavaccha"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

For those who are insolent, heedless,&lt;br&gt;
their effluents increase.&lt;br&gt;
But those whose mindfulness immersed in the body&lt;br&gt;
is constantly well-undertaken,&lt;br&gt;
—who don’t engage in what shouldn’t be done,&lt;br&gt;
who persevere in what should be done,&lt;br&gt;

their effluents go to their end.&lt;br&gt;
Go by the straight path pointed out,&lt;br&gt;
don’t turn back.&lt;br&gt;
You yourself should reprove yourself&lt;br&gt;
should advance to unbinding.&lt;br&gt;

the Teacher unexcelled in the world,&lt;br&gt;
the One with Eyes,&lt;br&gt;

The three knowledges are attained.&lt;br&gt;

When one’s awareness is dedicated&lt;br&gt;

the ending of craving, &amp;amp; non-deludedness,&lt;br&gt;
seeing the arising of the sense media,&lt;br&gt;
the mind is rightly released.&lt;br&gt;
For that monk, rightly released,&lt;br&gt;
his heart at peace.&lt;br&gt;
There’s nothing to be done,&lt;br&gt;
nothing to add&lt;br&gt;
to what’s done.&lt;br&gt;
As a single mass of rock isn’t moved by the wind,&lt;br&gt;
even so all&lt;br&gt;
forms, flavors, sounds,&lt;br&gt;
aromas, contacts,&lt;br&gt;
ideas desirable &amp;amp; not,&lt;br&gt;
have no effect on one who is Such.&lt;br&gt;
The mind&lt;br&gt;
—still, totally released—&lt;br&gt;
focuses on&lt;br&gt;
their passing away.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Verse 13</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.13/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="113-vanavaccha"&gt;1.13 Vanavaccha&lt;a class="anchor" href="#113-vanavaccha"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Buddha - era he was born as the son of Vanavaccha&amp;rsquo;s sister. When his mother heard that her eldest brother Vanavaccha had left the world, had graduated in the Order, and was dwelling in the forest, she said to her son: &amp;lsquo;Dear Sīvaka, you should leave the world under the Elder, and wait on him; the Elder is getting old now.&amp;rsquo; He, at this sole bidding of his mother, and because of his previous aspirations, did so and, ministering to his uncle, dwelt in the forest. One day, when he had gone to the outskirts of the village on some [19] errand, he fell very ill. And when medicine did not cure him and he came not, the Elder, wondering at the reason, went and found him ill. Administering remedies and tending him the Elder, when dawn was nigh, said: &amp;lsquo;Sīvaka, since the time when I left the world, I have not sojourned in the village. Let us go hence into the forest.&amp;rsquo; Sivaka answered: &amp;lsquo;Sir, even if my body stay now by the village, my heart is in the forest, wherefore though I lie here yet shall I go thither.&amp;rsquo; Then the Elder took hold of his arm and led him to the forest exhorting him. He, made steadfast by that admonition, won arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.14 Sīvaka</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.14-commentary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.14-commentary/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="sīvaka"&gt;Sīvaka&lt;a class="anchor" href="#s%c4%abvaka"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone lost in the middle of the ocean,&lt;br&gt;
Were to clamber up on a little log, they’d sink;&lt;br&gt;
In the same way, even a good person would sink&lt;br&gt;
If they rely on a lazy person.&lt;br&gt;
So avoid those who are lazy, lacking energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, dwell with the wise—&lt;br&gt;
Secluded, noble,&lt;br&gt;
Resolute, practising jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
And always energetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmigrating, I went to hell;&lt;br&gt;
Again and again, I went to the ghost realm;&lt;br&gt;
Many times I dwelt long&lt;br&gt;
In the suffering of the animal realm.&lt;br&gt;
I was also reborn as a human;&lt;br&gt;
From time to time I went to heaven;&lt;br&gt;

And the incorporeal,&lt;br&gt;
Among the percipient-nor-non-percipient,&lt;br&gt;
And the non-percipient.&lt;br&gt;
I understood these states of existence&lt;br&gt;
To be worthless:&lt;br&gt;
Conditioned, unstable, always in motion.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“May these beings be killed!&lt;br&gt;

Measureless and well-developed,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m friend and comrade to all,&lt;br&gt;
Compassionate to all beings,&lt;br&gt;
Developing a mind of loving-kindness,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I went forth&lt;br&gt;
from home into homelessness,&lt;br&gt;
I haven’t known&lt;br&gt;
an ignoble, aversive resolve.&lt;br&gt;
“May these beings&lt;br&gt;
be destroyed,&lt;br&gt;
be slaughtered,&lt;br&gt;
fall into pain”—&lt;br&gt;
I’ve not known this resolve&lt;br&gt;
in this long, long time.&lt;br&gt;
But I have known goodwill,&lt;br&gt;
unlimited,&lt;br&gt;
fully developed,&lt;br&gt;
nurtured step after step,&lt;br&gt;
as taught by the One&lt;br&gt;
Awake:&lt;br&gt;
to all, a friend;&lt;br&gt;
to all, a comrade;&lt;br&gt;
for all beings, sympathetic.&lt;br&gt;
And I develop a mind of goodwill,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in non-malevolence&lt;br&gt;
—always.&lt;br&gt;
Unvanquished, unshaken,&lt;br&gt;
I gladden the mind.&lt;br&gt;
I develop the sublime abiding,&lt;br&gt;
not frequented by&lt;br&gt;
the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
Attaining no-thinking,&lt;br&gt;
the disciple of the Rightly&lt;br&gt;
Self-awakened One&lt;br&gt;
is endowed with noble silence&lt;br&gt;
straightaway.&lt;br&gt;
As a mountain of rock&lt;br&gt;
is unmoving,&lt;br&gt;
firmly established,&lt;br&gt;
so a monk,&lt;br&gt;
with the ending of delusion,&lt;br&gt;
like a mountain,&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t quake.&lt;br&gt;
To a person without blemish,&lt;br&gt;
in constant quest of what’s pure,&lt;br&gt;
a hair-tip of evil&lt;br&gt;
seems a storm cloud.&lt;br&gt;
As a frontier fortress is guarded&lt;br&gt;
within &amp;amp; without,&lt;br&gt;
you should safeguard yourselves.&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let the moment&lt;br&gt;
pass you by.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time&lt;br&gt;
like a worker his wage.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time,&lt;br&gt;
mindful, alert.&lt;br&gt;
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done;&lt;br&gt;
the heavy load, laid down;&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming, uprooted.&lt;br&gt;
And the goal for which I went forth&lt;br&gt;
from home life into homelessness&lt;br&gt;
I’ve reached:&lt;br&gt;
the end&lt;br&gt;
of all fetters.&lt;br&gt;
Attain consummation&lt;br&gt;
through heedfulness:&lt;br&gt;
That is my message.&lt;br&gt;
So then, I’m about to&lt;br&gt;
unbind.&lt;br&gt;
I’m released&lt;br&gt;
everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Verse 14</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.14/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.14/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="114-vanavacchas-pupil"&gt;1.14 Vanavaccha’s pupil&lt;a class="anchor" href="#114-vanavacchas-pupil"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A human being, self-awakened,&lt;br&gt;
his mind tamed, concentrated,&lt;br&gt;
traveling along the Brahmā road,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the stilling of the mind:&lt;br&gt;
He, having gone beyond all dhammas,&lt;br&gt;
to whom human beings pay homage,&lt;br&gt;
the devas pay homage as well—&lt;br&gt;
so I have heard from the Worthy One&lt;br&gt;
—to him, gone past all fetters,&lt;br&gt;
gone from the forest to the clearing,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the renunciation of sensuality,&lt;br&gt;
released like gold from its ore.&lt;br&gt;
He, the nāga outshining all others,&lt;br&gt;
as the Himalayas, rocky hills:&lt;br&gt;
Among all things named nāga,&lt;br&gt;
he, unexcelled, is truly named.&lt;br&gt;
I will praise the nāga to you—&lt;br&gt;
for he does no misdeed.&lt;br&gt;
Composure &amp;amp; harmlessness&lt;br&gt;
are the nāga’s two feet.&lt;br&gt;
Austerity &amp;amp; celibacy&lt;br&gt;
are the nāga’s two other feet.&lt;br&gt;
Conviction is the great nāga’s trunk,&lt;br&gt;
his hand;&lt;br&gt;
equanimity, his white tusks.&lt;br&gt;
Mindfulness his neck; his head:&lt;br&gt;
discernment,&lt;br&gt;
discrimination,&lt;br&gt;
reflection on dhammas;&lt;br&gt;
Dhamma the balanced heat of his digestion;&lt;br&gt;
seclusion his tail.&lt;br&gt;
He, in jhāna, delighting in assurance,&lt;br&gt;
inwardly well-concentrated,&lt;br&gt;
the nāga, when going, is concentrated,&lt;br&gt;
when standing, the nāga is concentrated,&lt;br&gt;
when reclining, the nāga is concentrated,&lt;br&gt;
when sitting, the nāga is concentrated.&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere he’s restrained, the nāga:&lt;br&gt;
That is the nāga’s consummation.&lt;br&gt;
He eats what is blameless;&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t eat what is not;&lt;br&gt;
on gaining food &amp;amp; clothing,&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t store it up.&lt;br&gt;
Having cut all bonds,&lt;br&gt;
fetters tiny &amp;amp; large,&lt;br&gt;
wherever he goes,&lt;br&gt;
he goes without longing.&lt;br&gt;
Like a white lotus, born &amp;amp; growing in the water,&lt;br&gt;
but not smeared by the water&lt;br&gt;
—fragrant, delightful—&lt;br&gt;
even so the awakened one,&lt;br&gt;
well-born in the world, lives in the world,&lt;br&gt;
but is not smeared by the world,&lt;br&gt;
like the lotus, by the water.&lt;br&gt;
A great blazing fire&lt;br&gt;
unnourished grows calm,&lt;br&gt;
and though its embers exist&lt;br&gt;
is described as unbound:&lt;br&gt;
Conveying an instructive meaning,&lt;br&gt;
this image is taught by the observant.&lt;br&gt;
Great nāgas will recognize&lt;br&gt;
the nāga as taught by the nāga&lt;br&gt;
as free from passion,&lt;br&gt;
free from aversion,&lt;br&gt;
free from delusion,&lt;br&gt;
effluent-free.&lt;br&gt;
His body discarded, the nāga&lt;br&gt;
will, without effluent,&lt;br&gt;
totally unbind.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.16</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.16/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.16/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="116-belaṭṭhasīsa"&gt;1.16 Belaṭṭhasīsa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#116-bela%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adhas%c4%absa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

“Those who&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of sacrifice&lt;br&gt;

Why don’t you lament&lt;br&gt;
in the face of what’s greatly to be feared?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ven. Adhimutta:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“There are no painful mind-states, chieftain,&lt;br&gt;
in one without longing.&lt;br&gt;
In one whose fetters are ended,&lt;br&gt;
all fears are overcome.&lt;br&gt;
With the ending of [craving]&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming,&lt;br&gt;
when phenomena are seen&lt;br&gt;
for what they are,&lt;br&gt;
then as in the laying down of a burden,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no fear in death.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve lived well the holy life,&lt;br&gt;
well-developed the path.&lt;br&gt;
Death holds no fear for me.&lt;br&gt;
It’s like the end of a disease.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve lived well the holy life,&lt;br&gt;
well-developed the path,&lt;br&gt;
seen states of becoming&lt;br&gt;
as devoid of allure,&lt;br&gt;
like poison spit out&lt;br&gt;
after it’s drunk.&lt;br&gt;
One gone to the far shore&lt;br&gt;
without clinging,&lt;br&gt;
effluent-free,&lt;br&gt;
his task completed,&lt;br&gt;
welcomes the ending of life,&lt;br&gt;
as if freed from a place of execution.&lt;br&gt;
Having attained the supreme Rightness,&lt;br&gt;
unconcerned with all the world,&lt;br&gt;
as if released from a burning house,&lt;br&gt;
he doesn’t sorrow at death.&lt;br&gt;
Whatever’s compounded,&lt;br&gt;
wherever a state of becoming’s obtained,&lt;br&gt;
all that has no one in charge:&lt;br&gt;
So says the Great Seer.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever discerns this,&lt;br&gt;
as taught by the Awakened One,&lt;br&gt;
would no more grasp hold&lt;br&gt;
of any state of becoming&lt;br&gt;
than he would&lt;br&gt;
a hot iron ball.&lt;br&gt;
I have no ‘I was,’&lt;br&gt;
no ‘I will be.’&lt;br&gt;
Fabrications will simply&lt;br&gt;
go out of existence.&lt;br&gt;
What’s to lament there in that?&lt;br&gt;
For one who sees, as it actually is,&lt;br&gt;
the pure arising of phenomena,&lt;br&gt;
the pure seriality of fabrications,&lt;br&gt;
there’s no fear.&lt;br&gt;
When seeing the world,&lt;br&gt;
with discernment,&lt;br&gt;
as on a par&lt;br&gt;
with grass &amp;amp; twigs,&lt;br&gt;
finding no ‘mine-ness,’&lt;br&gt;
thinking, ‘There’s nothing of mine,’&lt;br&gt;
he feels no sorrow.&lt;br&gt;
Dissatisfied with this carcass,&lt;br&gt;
I’m unconcerned with becoming.&lt;br&gt;
This body will break up&lt;br&gt;
and there will not be another.&lt;br&gt;
Do as you like with this carcass.&lt;br&gt;
From that I will feel&lt;br&gt;
neither hatred nor love.”&lt;br&gt;
Hearing these awesome, hair-raising words,&lt;br&gt;
the young men threw down their weapons &amp;amp; said:&lt;br&gt;
“What have you done, sir,&lt;br&gt;
or who have you taken as mentor?&lt;br&gt;
Because of whose teachings&lt;br&gt;
is this lack of sorrow acquired?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ven. Adhimutta:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“The all-knowing,&lt;br&gt;
all-seeing conqueror:&lt;br&gt;
He is my mentor.&lt;br&gt;
Greatly compassionate teacher,&lt;br&gt;
all the world’s healer,&lt;br&gt;
this doctrine is his,&lt;br&gt;
unexcelled, leading to ending.&lt;br&gt;
Because of his teachings&lt;br&gt;
is this lack of sorrow acquired.”&lt;br&gt;
The bandits, hearing the good words of the seer,&lt;br&gt;
threw down their swords &amp;amp; their weapons.&lt;br&gt;
Some relinquished their life of crime,&lt;br&gt;
some chose the Going-forth.&lt;br&gt;
Having gone forth in the teachings&lt;br&gt;
of the One Well-Gone,&lt;br&gt;
developing the strengths&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; factors for awakening,&lt;br&gt;
wise, happy,&lt;br&gt;
exultant in mind,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindful, heedful,&lt;br&gt;
his mind well-centered,&lt;br&gt;
absorbed with restrained resolves,&lt;br&gt;
inwardly delighting&lt;br&gt;
in his conduct, his mindfulness,&lt;br&gt;
alone, content:&lt;br&gt;
He’s called a monk.&lt;br&gt;
Eating moist or dry food,&lt;br&gt;
he shouldn’t be heavily sated.&lt;br&gt;
With unfilled belly, with measured food,&lt;br&gt;
the monk should wander&lt;br&gt;
mindfully.&lt;br&gt;
Leaving four or five mouthfuls uneaten,&lt;br&gt;
he should drink water:&lt;br&gt;
This is enough&lt;br&gt;
for the easeful abiding&lt;br&gt;
of a resolute monk.&lt;br&gt;
And he covers himself with a proper robe&lt;br&gt;
enough for that purpose:&lt;br&gt;
This is enough&lt;br&gt;
for the easeful abiding&lt;br&gt;
of a resolute monk.&lt;br&gt;
As he sits cross-legged,&lt;br&gt;
it doesn’t rain on his knees:&lt;br&gt;
This is enough&lt;br&gt;
for the easeful abiding&lt;br&gt;
of a resolute monk.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever sees pleasure as pain,&lt;br&gt;
and pain as an arrow,&lt;br&gt;
and that there’s nothing between the two:&lt;br&gt;
With what will he be what in the world?&lt;br&gt;
“May I never have anything to do&lt;br&gt;
with a person of evil desires,&lt;br&gt;
lazy, lowly in his persistence,&lt;br&gt;
with little learning, disrespectful”:&lt;br&gt;
With what will he be what in the world?&lt;br&gt;
But one who is learned, wise,&lt;br&gt;
well-centered in virtues,&lt;br&gt;
devoted to tranquility of awareness:&lt;br&gt;
Let him stand at the head.&lt;br&gt;
One who is devoted to objectification,&lt;br&gt;
his heart delighting in objectification,&lt;br&gt;
attains no unbinding,&lt;br&gt;
the unexcelled rest from the yoke.&lt;br&gt;
But whoever, abandoning objectification,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the path of non-objectification,&lt;br&gt;
attains unbinding,&lt;br&gt;
the unexcelled rest from the yoke.&lt;br&gt;
In village or wilds,&lt;br&gt;
valley, plateau:&lt;br&gt;
that place is delightful&lt;br&gt;
where arahants dwell.&lt;br&gt;
Delightful wilds&lt;br&gt;
where the crowds don’t delight,&lt;br&gt;
those free from passion&lt;br&gt;
delight,&lt;br&gt;
for they’re not searching&lt;br&gt;
for sensual pleasures.&lt;br&gt;
Regard him as one who&lt;br&gt;
points out&lt;br&gt;
treasure,&lt;br&gt;
the wise one who&lt;br&gt;
seeing your faults&lt;br&gt;
rebukes you.&lt;br&gt;
Stay with this sort of sage.&lt;br&gt;
For the one who stays&lt;br&gt;
with a sage of this sort,&lt;br&gt;
things get better,&lt;br&gt;
not worse.&lt;br&gt;
Let him admonish, instruct,&lt;br&gt;
deflect you&lt;br&gt;
away from poor manners.&lt;br&gt;
To the good, he’s endearing;&lt;br&gt;
to the bad, he’s not.&lt;br&gt;
He, the Blessed One, the One&lt;br&gt;
Awakened, the One with Eyes,&lt;br&gt;
was teaching Dhamma to another.&lt;br&gt;
And while the Dhamma was being taught,&lt;br&gt;
I, desiring the Dhamma,&lt;br&gt;
turned an attentive ear.&lt;br&gt;
My listening was not in vain:&lt;br&gt;
I’m released, effluent-free.&lt;br&gt;
Not for knowledge of previous lifetimes,&lt;br&gt;
nor for the divine eye,&lt;br&gt;
nor for knowledge of others’ minds,&lt;br&gt;
nor for psychic power,&lt;br&gt;
nor for knowledge of beings dying &amp;amp; being reborn,&lt;br&gt;
nor for purifying the divine ear&lt;br&gt;
did I have any aspiration.&lt;br&gt;
Sitting at the root of a tree,&lt;br&gt;
with shaven head,&lt;br&gt;
wrapped in an outer robe,&lt;br&gt;
the elder foremost in discernment:&lt;br&gt;
Upatissa does jhāna.&lt;br&gt;
Attaining no-thinking,&lt;br&gt;
the disciple of the Rightly&lt;br&gt;
Self-Awakened One&lt;br&gt;
is endowed with noble silence&lt;br&gt;
straightaway.&lt;br&gt;
As a mountain of rock&lt;br&gt;
is unwavering, well-settled,&lt;br&gt;
so a monk whose delusion is ended&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t quiver—&lt;br&gt;
just like a mountain.&lt;br&gt;
To a person without blemish,&lt;br&gt;
in constant quest of what’s pure,&lt;br&gt;
a hair-tip of evil&lt;br&gt;
seems a storm cloud.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time&lt;br&gt;
like a worker his wage.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t delight in death,&lt;br&gt;
don’t delight in living.&lt;br&gt;
I await my time,&lt;br&gt;
mindful, alert.&lt;br&gt;
On either side is death,&lt;br&gt;
it’s not non-death, ahead or behind.&lt;br&gt;
Practice, don’t perish.&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let the moment pass you by.&lt;br&gt;
As a frontier fortress is guarded&lt;br&gt;
within &amp;amp; without,&lt;br&gt;
you should safeguard yourselves.&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let the moment&lt;br&gt;
pass you by.&lt;br&gt;
Those for whom the moment is past&lt;br&gt;
grieve, consigned to hell.&lt;br&gt;
Calmed, restrained,&lt;br&gt;
giving counsel unruffled,&lt;br&gt;
he shakes off evil qualities—&lt;br&gt;
as the breeze,&lt;br&gt;
a leaf from a tree.&lt;br&gt;
Calmed, restrained,&lt;br&gt;
giving counsel unruffled,&lt;br&gt;
he removed evil qualities—&lt;br&gt;
as the breeze,&lt;br&gt;
a leaf from a tree.&lt;br&gt;
You shouldn’t trust in this way&lt;br&gt;
some householders or those gone forth.&lt;br&gt;
Having been good, they become bad.&lt;br&gt;
Having been bad, they become good.&lt;br&gt;
Sensual desire, ill will,&lt;br&gt;
sloth &amp;amp; torpor,&lt;br&gt;
restlessness &amp;amp; uncertainty:&lt;br&gt;
These, for a monk, are the five defilements.&lt;br&gt;
The concentration of one&lt;br&gt;
dwelling in heedfulness&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t waver,&lt;br&gt;
whether he is honored or not.&lt;br&gt;
Doing jhāna, persevering,&lt;br&gt;
having&lt;br&gt;
subtle insight into&lt;br&gt;
subtle views,&lt;br&gt;
delighting in the ending of clinging:&lt;br&gt;
He’s called a man of integrity.&lt;br&gt;
The great ocean, the Earth,&lt;br&gt;
a mountain, even the wind&lt;br&gt;
aren’t fitting as a comparison&lt;br&gt;
for the Teacher’s foremost release.&lt;br&gt;
Keeping the (Dhamma) wheel going,&lt;br&gt;
the elder of great knowledge, centered,&lt;br&gt;
being like earth, fire, &amp;amp; water,&lt;br&gt;
is neither impassioned nor angered.&lt;br&gt;
Having attained perfection in discernment,&lt;br&gt;
greatly intelligent, a great sage,&lt;br&gt;
not dull, though seemingly dull,&lt;br&gt;
he always wanders unbound.&lt;br&gt;
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done;&lt;br&gt;
the heavy load, laid down;&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming, uprooted.&lt;br&gt;
Attain consummation&lt;br&gt;
through heedfulness:&lt;br&gt;
That is my message.&lt;br&gt;
So then, I’m about to&lt;br&gt;
unbind.&lt;br&gt;
I’m released&lt;br&gt;
everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.18</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/archive/thag1.18/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="118-singāla-pitar1"&gt;1.18 Singāla-Pitar[1]&lt;a class="anchor" href="#118-sing%c4%81la-pitar1"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

right there.&lt;br&gt;
Sitting next to a wall,&lt;br&gt;
I ate that morsel of food,&lt;br&gt;
and neither while eating it,&lt;br&gt;
nor having eaten,&lt;br&gt;
did I feel&lt;br&gt;
any disgust.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever has mastered&lt;br&gt;
left-over scraps for food,&lt;br&gt;
smelly urine for medicine,&lt;br&gt;
the foot of a tree for a dwelling,&lt;br&gt;
cast-off rags for robes:&lt;br&gt;
He is a man&lt;br&gt;
of the four directions.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
Where some are exhausted&lt;br&gt;
climbing the mountain,&lt;br&gt;
there&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s heir&lt;br&gt;
—mindful, alert,&lt;br&gt;
buoyed by his psychic power—&lt;br&gt;
Kassapa climbs.&lt;br&gt;
Returning from his alms round,&lt;br&gt;
climbing the peak,&lt;br&gt;
Kassapa does jhāna&lt;br&gt;
with no clinging,&lt;br&gt;
having abandoned terror&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; fear.&lt;br&gt;
Returning from his alms round,&lt;br&gt;
climbing the peak,&lt;br&gt;
Kassapa does jhāna&lt;br&gt;
with no clinging,&lt;br&gt;
unbound&lt;br&gt;
among those who burn.&lt;br&gt;
Returning from his alms round,&lt;br&gt;
climbing the peak,&lt;br&gt;
Kassapa does jhāna&lt;br&gt;
with no clinging,&lt;br&gt;
effluent-free,&lt;br&gt;
his task done.&lt;br&gt;
Spread with garlands of vines,&lt;br&gt;
places delighting the mind,&lt;br&gt;
resounding with elephants,&lt;br&gt;
appealing:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
The color of blue-dark clouds,&lt;br&gt;
glistening,&lt;br&gt;
cooled with the waters&lt;br&gt;
of clear-flowing streams&lt;br&gt;
covered with ladybugs:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
Like the peaks of blue-dark clouds,&lt;br&gt;
like excellent peaked-roof buildings,&lt;br&gt;
resounding with tuskers,&lt;br&gt;
appealing:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
Their lovely surfaces wet with rain,&lt;br&gt;
mountains frequented&lt;br&gt;
by seers&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; echoing&lt;br&gt;
with peacocks:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
This is enough for me—&lt;br&gt;
desiring to do jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
resolute, mindful;&lt;br&gt;
enough for me—&lt;br&gt;
desiring the goal,&lt;br&gt;
resolute,&lt;br&gt;
a monk;&lt;br&gt;
enough for me—&lt;br&gt;
desiring comfort,&lt;br&gt;
resolute,&lt;br&gt;
trained;&lt;br&gt;
enough for me—&lt;br&gt;
desiring my duty,&lt;br&gt;
resolute,&lt;br&gt;
Such.&lt;br&gt;
Flax-flower blue,&lt;br&gt;
like the sky&lt;br&gt;
covered over with clouds;&lt;br&gt;
filled with flocks&lt;br&gt;
of various birds:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
Uncrowded&lt;br&gt;
by householders,&lt;br&gt;
frequented&lt;br&gt;
by herds of deer&lt;br&gt;
filled with flocks&lt;br&gt;
of various birds:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
With clear waters &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
massive boulders,&lt;br&gt;
frequented by monkeys &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
deer,&lt;br&gt;
covered with moss &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
water weeds:&lt;br&gt;
Those rocky crags&lt;br&gt;
refresh me.&lt;br&gt;
There is no such pleasure for me&lt;br&gt;
in the music of a five-piece band&lt;br&gt;
as there is when my mind&lt;br&gt;
is at one,&lt;br&gt;
seeing the Dhamma&lt;br&gt;
aright.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
One shouldn’t do lots of work,&lt;br&gt;
should avoid people,&lt;br&gt;
shouldn’t busy oneself.&lt;br&gt;
He’s eager &amp;amp; greedy for flavors,&lt;br&gt;
whoever misses the goal&lt;br&gt;
that brings bliss.&lt;br&gt;
One shouldn’t do lots of work,&lt;br&gt;
should avoid&lt;br&gt;
what doesn’t lead to the goal.&lt;br&gt;
The body gets wearied,&lt;br&gt;
fatigued.&lt;br&gt;
Aching, one finds&lt;br&gt;
no tranquility.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
Simply by flapping the mouth&lt;br&gt;
one doesn’t see&lt;br&gt;
even oneself.&lt;br&gt;
One goes around stiff-&lt;br&gt;
necked,&lt;br&gt;
thinking, ‘I’m better&lt;br&gt;
than they.’&lt;br&gt;
Not better,&lt;br&gt;
he thinks himself better,&lt;br&gt;
the fool:&lt;br&gt;
The wise don’t praise him,&lt;br&gt;
the stiff-necked man.&lt;br&gt;
But whoever isn’t stirred&lt;br&gt;
by the modes of&lt;br&gt;
‘I’m better,&lt;br&gt;
not better.&lt;br&gt;
I’m worse.&lt;br&gt;
I’m like that’;&lt;br&gt;
one who’s discerning,&lt;br&gt;
who acts as he says,&lt;br&gt;
well-centered&lt;br&gt;
in virtues,&lt;br&gt;
committed to&lt;br&gt;
tranquility of awareness, he&lt;br&gt;
is the one&lt;br&gt;
the wise&lt;br&gt;
would praise.&lt;br&gt;
One with no respect&lt;br&gt;
for his fellows in the holy life,&lt;br&gt;
is as far&lt;br&gt;
from true Dhamma&lt;br&gt;
as the earth&lt;br&gt;
from the sky.&lt;br&gt;
But those whose sense of shame&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; compunction&lt;br&gt;
are always rightly established: They&lt;br&gt;
have flourished in the holy life.&lt;br&gt;
For them&lt;br&gt;
there’s no further becoming.&lt;br&gt;
A monk conceited &amp;amp; vain,&lt;br&gt;
even though clad&lt;br&gt;
in a robe of cast-off rags,&lt;br&gt;
like a monkey in a lion’s skin,&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t shine because of it.&lt;br&gt;
But a monk not conceited&lt;br&gt;
or vain,&lt;br&gt;
masterful,&lt;br&gt;
his faculties restrained, shines&lt;br&gt;
because of his robe of cast-off rags,&lt;br&gt;
like a lion&lt;br&gt;
in the cleft of a mountain.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
These many devas,&lt;br&gt;
powerful, prestigious&lt;br&gt;
—10,000 devas—&lt;br&gt;
all of Brahmā’s retinue,&lt;br&gt;
stand with their hands over their hearts,&lt;br&gt;
paying homage to Sāriputta,&lt;br&gt;
the Dhamma-general,&lt;br&gt;
enlightened,&lt;br&gt;
centered,&lt;br&gt;
great master of jhāna,&lt;br&gt;
[saying:]&lt;br&gt;
‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred man.&lt;br&gt;
Homage to you, O superlative man—&lt;br&gt;
of whom we have no direct knowledge&lt;br&gt;
even of that&lt;br&gt;
in dependence on which&lt;br&gt;
you do jhāna.&lt;br&gt;
‘How very amazing:&lt;br&gt;
the awakened ones’&lt;br&gt;
very own deep range—&lt;br&gt;
of which we have no direct knowledge,&lt;br&gt;
though we have come&lt;br&gt;
as hair-splitting archers.’&lt;br&gt;
Seeing Sāriputta,&lt;br&gt;
a man worthy of worship,&lt;br&gt;
worshipped by deva retinues,&lt;br&gt;
Kappina&lt;br&gt;
smiled.&lt;br&gt;
* * *&lt;br&gt;
As far as this buddha-field extends&lt;br&gt;
—except for the great sage himself—&lt;br&gt;
I’m the one&lt;br&gt;
outstanding&lt;br&gt;
in ascetic qualities.&lt;br&gt;
There’s no one else&lt;br&gt;
like me.&lt;br&gt;
The Teacher has been served by me;&lt;br&gt;
the Awakened One’s bidding,&lt;br&gt;
done;&lt;br&gt;
the heavy load, laid down;&lt;br&gt;
the guide to becoming, uprooted.&lt;br&gt;
Neither to robe,&lt;br&gt;
nor dwelling,&lt;br&gt;
nor food&lt;br&gt;
does he cling:&lt;br&gt;
Gotama,&lt;br&gt;
like a lotus unspotted&lt;br&gt;
by water, inclining&lt;br&gt;
to renunciation, detached&lt;br&gt;
from the three planes of becoming.&lt;br&gt;
He,&lt;br&gt;
the great sage,&lt;br&gt;
has the establishings of mindfulness&lt;br&gt;
as his neck,&lt;br&gt;
conviction&lt;br&gt;
as hands,&lt;br&gt;
discernment&lt;br&gt;
as head.&lt;br&gt;
Having great knowledge,&lt;br&gt;
he goes about&lt;br&gt;
always unbound.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Verse 18</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.18/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="118-siṅgālapitar"&gt;1.18 Siṅgālapitar&lt;a class="anchor" href="#118-si%e1%b9%85g%c4%81lapitar"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an heir to the One Awakened,&lt;br&gt;
a monk in the Bhesakaḷā forest,&lt;br&gt;
who suffused this whole earth&lt;br&gt;
with the perception of&lt;br&gt;
“bones.”&lt;br&gt;
Quickly, I’d say, he abandoned&lt;br&gt;
sensual passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He in this Buddha-age was reborn in an eminent brahmin&amp;rsquo;s family at Sāvatthī. And on the day when Jeta Grove was presented, he saw the majesty of the Buddha and was satisfied, so that he entered the Order. When he had stirred up insight, he soon became able to exercise the six forms of supernormal thought. And pondering, in the bliss of fruition, on the advantages of the doctrine which leads us away from rebirth, he uttered this verse as the expression of aññā:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.21 Nigrodha</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.21/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="121-nigrodha"&gt;1.21 Nigrodha&lt;a class="anchor" href="#121-nigrodha"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

With bowl and hands washed, and refreshed by the appropriate fare offered him, he put forth insight without toil and, with mind intent on [28] the ebb and flow of all things, attained the topmost meditation of the Paths, winning arahantship, with mastery of the form and meaning of the doctrine.

Thereafter, when the king died, Abhaya grew anxious and left the world for the Order. Through the preaching of the Sutta on the parable of the hole in the yoke, he reached the First Path; again, stirring up insight, he realized arahantship. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thereupon, glorying in that which he had won, he confessed aññā saying:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.26 Ab</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.26/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="126-ab"&gt;1.26 Ab&lt;a class="anchor" href="#126-ab"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

And our Thera, being unable to explain it, uttered the wish: &amp;lsquo;May I in the future become able to teach thee the Happy-Lonely!&amp;rsquo; The other answered: &amp;lsquo;May I ask thee!&amp;rsquo; Of these two the former, when our Buddha lived, was reborn at Kapilavatthu, in the house of a Sakiyan rāja.

&lt;p&gt;Becoming (bhava) is a term to describe a sense of identity in a particular world of experience, which can develop on any of three levels: sensuality, form, or formlessness. Craving for becoming is one of the causes of stress and suffering; passion for becoming is one of the last fetters abandoned at full awakening.

&lt;p&gt;I sat close by wise people,&lt;br&gt;
And learnt the Dhamma many times.&lt;br&gt;
What I learnt, I practiced,&lt;br&gt;
Entering the road that culminates in the deathless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve slain the desire to be reborn&lt;br&gt;
In any state of existence,&lt;br&gt;
Such desire won’t be found in me again.&lt;br&gt;
It was not, and it won’t be in me,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, in a brahmin&amp;rsquo;s family, and named Aggidatta. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When grown [36] up he saw the Exalted One work the twin-miracle, &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and, being convinced, he entered the Order. Taking a subject for meditation, he went to the Ratīra forest, and became known as Gahva-Ratīriya. Growing in insight, he in a short time attained arahantship. Thereupon he went to worship the Exalted One at Sāvatthī. His kinsfolk, hearing of his coming, bestowed liberal gifts upon him. And when he wished to go back to the forest, they said: &amp;lsquo;Sir, the forest is full of peril through the gadflies and mosquitoes. Stay here!&amp;rsquo; But the Thera, devoted to detachment, replied, &amp;lsquo;Life in the forest suits me,&amp;rsquo; and confessing aññā he uttered this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.31 Gahvaratīriya</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.31/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.31/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="131-gahvaratīriya"&gt;1.31 Gahvaratīriya&lt;a class="anchor" href="#131-gahvarat%c4%abriya"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the great forest, in the mighty woods,&lt;br&gt;

In the teaching of the Buddha,&lt;br&gt;
Letting go, I rose up;&lt;br&gt;
I escaped the realm of sensual pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, under the supervision&lt;br&gt;
Of the supreme Buddha,&lt;br&gt;
My mind was freed.&lt;br&gt;
I know that my freedom is unshakeable,&lt;br&gt;
Because all fetters have ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, of a very poor woman. In her travail his mother fell into a long deep swoon, so that her kinsfolk said &amp;lsquo;She is dead!&amp;rsquo; And they bore her to the cemetery, and prepared to cremate the body. But a spirit prevented the fire burning by a storm of wind and rain, so they went away. Then was the child born hale while the mother died. And the spirit, in human shape, took the infant and placed it in the watchman&amp;rsquo;s house, nourishing it for a time with suitable food. After that the watchman adopted it, and the child grew up with his own son Suppiya (Ps. XXXII.). And because of his birth in the cemetery, he became known as Sopāka, &amp;rsquo;the Waif.&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When he was seven years&amp;rsquo; old it came to pass that the Exalted One early in the morning spread out his Net of Insight to contemplate what folk might be brought in. And seeing what the net enclosed, [38] he went to the cemetery. The boy, impelled by his antecedents, approached the Master with a gladdened mind and saluted him. The Master taught him, so that he asked to leave the world, and when bidden to gain his father&amp;rsquo;s consent, fetched the latter to the Master. The father saluted, and asked the Master to admit the boy. And the Master had him admitted, and assigned to him the study of fraternal love. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He, taking this exercise and dwelling in the cemetery, soon acquired the corresponding jhāna. And making that his base, &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; he fostered insight and realized arahantship. As arahant he showed in his verse to the other bhikkhus dwelling there the principle of the love exercises, bidding them make no difference between those who were to them friendly, indifferent, or hostile. For all alike their love should be one and the same in its nature, and should include all realms, all beings, at all ages:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.33 Sopāka</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.33/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.33/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="133-sopāka"&gt;1.33 Sopāka&lt;a class="anchor" href="#133-sop%c4%81ka"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Saying “Sensual pleasures are impermanent”;
But they are passionately enamoured
Of jewelled earrings,
Desiring children and wives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, they don’t know Dhamma,
Despite saying “Sensual pleasures are impermanent”;
They don’t have the power to cut their lust,
So they’re attached to children, wives, and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

What should one do to compass happiness both in this life and the next?&amp;rsquo; The Thera said: &amp;lsquo;Happiness not of the world: - this, for one who undergoes the suitable procedure to get it, and who gets it, is alone to be called unqualified happiness.&amp;rsquo; And to illustrate this by his own attainment, he uttered this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.35 Sāmaññakāni</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.35/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.35/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="135-sāmaññakāni"&gt;1.35 Sāmaññakāni&lt;a class="anchor" href="#135-s%c4%81ma%c3%b1%c3%b1ak%c4%81ni"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age as one of the four lay-companions of the Thera Yasa, who, when they heard of Yasa&amp;rsquo;s renunciation, imitated him, and also won arahantship. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thereafter he dwelt in the Añjana Grove at [43] Sāketa, experiencing the bliss of emancipation. Now at that time the Exalted One came also with a great company of bhikkhus to the Añjana Grove, and the accommodation was insufficient, many of the bhikkhus sleeping around the vihāra on the sandbanks of the River Sarabhū. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Then in the middle of the night the stream rose in flood, and a great cry arose from the younger brethren. The Exalted One hearing it, sent for the venerable Gavampati, and said: &amp;lsquo;Go, Gavampati, arrest the rising stream, and put the bhikkhus at ease.&amp;rsquo; And the Thera by his mystic power did so, and stopped the stream afar so that it stood up like a mountain-peak. Thenceforth the might of the Thera became known. One day as the Master sat teaching in the midst of a great assembly he saw Gavampati, and in compassion for the world praised his virtues in this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.38 Gavampati</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.38/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.38/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="138-gavampati"&gt;1.38 Gavampati&lt;a class="anchor" href="#138-gavampati"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha, in the house of a prosperous brahmin. Previous causes induced him, when King Bimbisāra met the Master, to take orders, and he went to a certain forest near the hills Vebhāra and Paṇḍava, and there dwelt devoted to religious exercises. And there arose once a great storm, and the lightnings entered the cave. But the wind from the pregnant clouds assuaged the heat and fever oppressing the Thera, so that by the more suitable temperature his heart grew concentrated, and he was able to exercise such insight that he won arahantship.

Such a Dhamma for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at a hamlet near Sāvatthī, in a poor family. Grown up, he earned his living in the fields, furnished with a little sickle, plough, and spade. Now one day when King Pasenadi of Kosala was bestowing a great offering on the Exalted One and the Order, he went, taking milk and butter, along with men who were taking woodwork. Seeing the attentions and honours paid to the Brethren and Sisters, he thought: These Sākiyan recluses live in sheltered lodgings and in delicate robes-what if I too were now to leave the world?&amp;rsquo; And he approached a certain great Thera and made known his intention. The Thera out of compassion admitted him, and sent him into the forest with an exercise. But in solitude he pined and wavered, and departed to his native village. Then as he went along he saw the peasants ploughing the fields in soiled garments, covered with dust blown by hot winds. And he thought: &amp;lsquo;Truly these fellows earn their living in great misery!&amp;rsquo; And feeling anxious, his insight approaching maturity, he set himself to do the exercises that had been given him, going to the roots of a tree, and biding in seclusion. Thus he finally won arahantship. Thereafter, to celebrate his own emancipation from the ills of life, he broke forth into this psalm:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.43 Sumaṅgala</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.43/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.43/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="143-sumaṅgala"&gt;1.43 Sumaṅgala&lt;a class="anchor" href="#143-suma%e1%b9%85gala"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, in the family of a lay-follower, after the father had left his home. The mother, naming him Sānu, brought him when he was seven years old to the bhikkhus for ordination, deeming she would thus ensure for him supreme happiness. Now Sānu, the Novice became very learned, a teacher of doctrine, and practised in the jhāna of love, being beloved by gods and men. And as we know from the Sānu-Sutta ( Saṁyutta Nikāya, i. 208) his mother, in his previous birth, was a Yakkha. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now as time went on Sānu lost his intellectual discernment and grew distraught, and longed to go a-roaming.

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha, as the son of a leading citizen, he lived in youthful wantonness. One day he saw the king&amp;rsquo;s officers arresting an adulterer, and grow- [50] ing agitated, he listened to the Master teaching, and left the world. As a bhikkhu, but still susceptible to fleshly lusts, he made himself a well-garnished chamber, &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; well furnished as to food and drink, seat and couch; and so he ever dwelt. For this reason he was known as Ramaṇīya-vihārin (Pleasant-lodge Brother). But his previous indulgence making the recluse&amp;rsquo;s life too hard for him, he felt unworthy to accept the offerings of the faithful and said: &amp;lsquo;I will roam.&amp;rsquo; On his way he sat down beneath a tree. And as carts were passing by on the road, one ox being weary stumbled at a rough place and fell. The carter loosened its yoke, gave it hay and water and so allayed its fatigue; then he harnessed it again and they went on. And the Thera thought: &amp;lsquo;Even as this ox having stumbled has arisen and draws his own load, so doth it behove me, who once have stumbled in the forest of vice, to arise and carry out the duty of a recluse.&amp;rsquo; And thoughtfully turning back, he told what he had done and seen to Thera Upāli, &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was by him absolved from his fault, and helped back into right ways. And not long after he attained arahantship. Thereafter enjoying the bliss of freedom, he set forth his lapse and return in this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.45 Ramaṇīyavihārin</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.45/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.45/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="145-ramaṇīyavihārin"&gt;1.45 Ramaṇīyavihārin&lt;a class="anchor" href="#145-rama%e1%b9%87%c4%abyavih%c4%81rin"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha, , in a clansman&amp;rsquo;s family. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; From the time he was born the wealth of his family increased, and he himself, handsome and virtuous, became known as Samiddhi (Prospero).

The latter bade him persist where he was and think no more about it. He obeyed, and soon after won arahantship. Māra, unaware of it, once more created a fearful noise. But the Thera felt no fear: &amp;lsquo;Undaunted by all such Māras, not once have I turned a hair!&amp;rsquo; And confessing aññā, he uttered this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.46 Samiddhi</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.46/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.46/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="146-samiddhi"&gt;1.46 Samiddhi&lt;a class="anchor" href="#146-samiddhi"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

free from passion,&lt;br&gt;

Know this, my friend:&lt;br&gt;
The hut you built&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His story resembles that of the Añjana -Woodlander, with this difference: he dwelt in a hut beside a hamlet in the Vajjian territory. It was a pretty pleasing little chalet, with floor and walls well prepared, surrounded by park and tank, and with its enclosure of smooth pearly sand. And the Thera&amp;rsquo;s excellent virtues enhanced its attractiveness. He there won arahantship, and there continued to dwell. Now when people came to see the vihāra (settlement), they could see the hut. One day a few fast women came by, and seeing the attractiveness of the hut said:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.58 Ramaṇīyakuṭika</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.58/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.58/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="158-ramaṇīyakuṭika"&gt;1.58 Ramaṇīyakuṭika&lt;a class="anchor" href="#158-rama%e1%b9%87%c4%abyaku%e1%b9%adika"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

May she, happy and healthy, give birth to a healthy child.&amp;rsquo; The rāja heard, saluted the Exalted One and set out for the village. Even before he came, Suppavāsā was delivered of a son. The persons [61] who had surrounded her with tearful faces went forth delighted to tell the rāja. He saw them coming and thought: &amp;lsquo;That which He of the Ten Powers told me has been fulfilled.&amp;rsquo; And he went to the princess and told her what the Master had pronounced. Then she bade him show	hospitality to	the Buddha	and the Order for	seven days.	And saying,	&amp;lsquo;The child	is born, bringing	gladness of heart to all our kin,&amp;rsquo; they named him Sīvali (Auspicious).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.60 Sī</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.60/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.60/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="160-sī"&gt;1.60 Sī&lt;a class="anchor" href="#160-s%c4%ab"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

On the fifth day he and his four mates won arahantship. Thereupon reflecting on the might of the Master and the blindness of the world, and how the Ariyan state bestowed vision, he said this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.61 V</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.61/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.61/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="161-v"&gt;1.61 V&lt;a class="anchor" href="#161-v"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Going one day to the village for alms, he sat down beneath a tree. Then a kite, seizing some flesh, flew up into the sky. Him many kites attacked, making him drop the meat. Another kite grabbed the fallen flesh, and was plundered by another.

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu, in the family of a Sākiyan raja, he was named Meghiya. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When grown up, he entered the Order and ministered to the Exalted One while he was residing at Calika on the River Kimikālā. And seeing a pleasant mango-wood he desired to dwell there. Twice the Exalted One refused, but at his third request, let him go. There, however, being consumed by evil thoughts as by flies, he got no concentration of mind, so he returned and told the Master. The latter said, &amp;lsquo;When the heart, Meghiya, is not ripe for emancipation, five things conduce thereto,&amp;rsquo; and admonished him. [ ed1 ] Whereupon Meghiya attained arahantship, and announced his aññā in this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.66 Meg</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.66/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.66/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="166-meg"&gt;1.66 Meg&lt;a class="anchor" href="#166-meg"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn when our Exalted One was alive in the house of King Suddhodana, of a slave, he was called Channa. A contemporary of the future Buddha, he found faith in the Master when the latter returned to meet his kinsfolk. He thereupon entered the Order. Out of his affection for Him, egoistic pride in &amp;lsquo;our Buddha, our Doctrine&amp;rsquo; arose, and he could not conquer this fondness, nor perform his duty as novice. When the Master had passed away, and his injunction that the higher penalty be imposed on Channa was carried out, &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the latter suffered anguish, extirpated his fondness, and soon after attained arahantship.

And he went to hear the Master at the Vihāra with the local lay-followers. There he believed, and left the world. And for a time he won favour among the teachers and preceptors by his skill in dialectic. Then one day he went to the Master, and asked for a lesson, so that he, hearing propositions pairwise, might therewith go to dwell in Sunāparanta. To him the Exalted One uttered a &amp;lsquo;Lion&amp;rsquo;s Roar&amp;rsquo; of a lesson, to wit: &amp;lsquo;Now there are objects, Puṇṇa, cognizable by the eye, etc.&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So Puṇṇa departed, and studying concentration and insight, acquired the three forms of higher cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.70 Puṇṇa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.70/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.70/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="170-puṇṇa"&gt;1.70 Puṇṇa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#170-pu%e1%b9%87%e1%b9%87a"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Vesālī, in the family of a Licchavi noble (rāja). When grown up he was ever mad for war and an unconquered fighter, ever sacrificing what was near and dear, so that he became known as Piyañjaha — Love-renouncing. But when the Master came to Vesālī, Piyañjaha found faith in him, entered the Order, dwelt in the forest, developed insight and won arahantship. As arahant he thought, &amp;lsquo;How different is worldly success from Ariyan success!&amp;rsquo; and by this insight confessing aññā, he uttered this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.76 Piyañjaha</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.76/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.76/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="176-piyañjaha"&gt;1.76 Piyañjaha&lt;a class="anchor" href="#176-piya%c3%b1jaha"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, in the family of an elephant-driver, as he grew up, he became proficient in managing elephants. One day, as he was training an elephant by the river, he was impelled by maturing conditions to think: &amp;lsquo;What is all this elephant-taming to me? Better is it to tame one&amp;rsquo;s self.&amp;rsquo; So he went to the Exalted One, heard the Norm, believed, entered the Order, and exercised himself in insight on a basis of ethical meditation. And as a skilful elephant-trainer restrains savage ways by his hook, so he by meditation suffered not his thoughts to wander away from his exercise, saying this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.77 Hatthāroha-Putta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.77/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.77/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="177-hatthāroha-putta"&gt;1.77 Hatthāroha-Putta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#177-hatth%c4%81roha-putta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāketa, in the family of a burgess. Because his head resembled that of a ram, he acquired the nickname of Meṇḍasīra (= ram&amp;rsquo;s head). While the Exalted One was staying at Sāketa in the Añjana Wood, Meṇḍasīra came to believe in him, entered the Order, and practising calm and insight, [77] acquired sixfold abhiññā.

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age in the township of Devadaha, in the family of a Sākiyan noble (rāja), he was named Rakkhita (Guarded). He was one of those five hundred young nobles who, as having renounced the world, were given by the Sākiyan and Koliyan rājas as escort to the Exalted One. The latter had converted these youths by the lesson of the Kuṇāla-jātaka &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - a lesson against the danger of sensuality. And connecting this lesson with his exercises, he developed insight and attained arahantship. Thereafter, reflecting on his own renunciation of the corruptions, &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; he uttered his verse confessing aññā:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.79 Rakkhita</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.79/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.79/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="179-rakkhita"&gt;1.79 Rakkhita&lt;a class="anchor" href="#179-rakkhita"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

As the consequence of his action in a former life, he was attacked by leprosy and his limbs crumbled off piece by piece. He dwelt in the infirmary. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And one day the General of the Norm went on his round of inquiry, asking after this and that sick bhikkhu. Seeing Samitigutta, he gave him an exercise on the contemplation [79] of feeling, saying &amp;lsquo;My friend, in so far as there is what we call process of the five constituents, the whole of suffering is a matter of feeling. But if just the constituents be absent, suffering is absent.&amp;rsquo; So saying, he went on; but the patient, set up by the lesson, developed insight and realized sixfold abhiññā. Thereupon he remembered the evil action in former births for which he was now overcome by disease. And extolling the fact that all was now done with, he uttered this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.81 Samitigutta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.81/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.81/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="181-samitigutta"&gt;1.81 Samitigutta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#181-samitigutta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a reference to the fact that the Buddha was an “open-handed” teacher who did not wait to the end of his life to give his most crucial teachings. See DN 16. The message of this verse may be related to the fact that the Buddha addressed three of his most plain-speaking suttas to Nāgita: AN 5:30, AN 6:42, and AN 8:103.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.87 Paviṭṭha</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.87-commentary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.87-commentary/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="paviṭṭha"&gt;Paviṭṭha&lt;a class="anchor" href="#pavi%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adha"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age in the kingdom of Magadha, in a brahmin&amp;rsquo;s family, and being naturally inclined to the life of a recluse, he became a Wanderer. His training ended, he wandered forth, and heard of Upatissa and Kolita (= Sāriputta and Moggallāna) joining the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s Order. And he thought: &amp;lsquo;That methinks must be a [83] better Order since such great sages enter it.&amp;rsquo; And he went and heard the Master, believed, and was ordained. Soon after he realized arahantship, and thus confessed aññā:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.87 Paviṭṭha</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.87/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.87/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="187-paviṭṭha"&gt;1.87 Paviṭṭha&lt;a class="anchor" href="#187-pavi%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adha"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

His parents wedded him to a maiden suitable for beauty, virtue, years, and accomplishments. But anon, because it was his final life, he grew agitated at continued being, and sought [87] the Master. After hearing him teach the Norm, Eraka left the world. And the Master gave him an exercise, but for some days he remained mastered by evil thoughts. Then the Master, knowing the course of his thoughts, admonished him in a verse. And he, on hearing it, thought: &amp;lsquo;Unfitly have I acted; I, fool, that I should have continued full of bad thoughts when learning from such a Master.&amp;rsquo; And in distress he devoted himself to gaining insight, and soon won arahantship.

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age in the kingdom of Magadha as the son of a brahmin, he was named Mettaji. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Grown up, he saw the evil of worldly desire, and became an ascetic dwelling in the forest. Hearing of the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s advent, and impelled by antecedent causes, he sought the Master and asked him concerning his progress and regress. The answer given convinced him that he should enter the Order, [88] whereupon he won arahantship. And in this verse he extolled the Master:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.94 Mettaji</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.94/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.94/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="194-mettaji"&gt;1.94 Mettaji&lt;a class="anchor" href="#194-mettaji"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, as the son of a landed proprietor named Mahā-Suvaṇṇā, and received the name of Pāla. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He was also called Pāla major, because his younger brother was called Pāla minor. And the parents bound the sons in domestic bonds. But the Master came to the Jeta Grove, and there Pāla major heard him, and leaving his brother to manage the property entered the Order. After five years of novitiate, he went with sixty bhikkhus to perfect his studies. And they chose a woodland spot near a border village, where the villagers were lay-followers, and he, dwelling in a leaf-hut, practised the duties of a recluse.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.95 Cakkhupāla</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.95/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.95/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="195-cakkhupāla"&gt;1.95 Cakkhupāla&lt;a class="anchor" href="#195-cakkhup%c4%81la"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Thereupon he remembered his own former births: how he had offered a plant of jasmine at the tope of Kassapa Buddha when all the plucked flowers went to form the king&amp;rsquo;s own offering; and, discerning how this act had guided him to Nibbāna now, he said this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.96 Khaṇḍasumana</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.96/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.96/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="196-khaṇḍasumana"&gt;1.96 Khaṇḍasumana&lt;a class="anchor" href="#196-kha%e1%b9%87%e1%b8%8dasumana"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age at the town of Roguva in a rāja&amp;rsquo;s family, at his father&amp;rsquo;s death he succeeded to the title. As an absent ally of King Bimbisāra, he sent him presents of jewels, pearls, and robes. The king sent him in return the life of the Buddha on a painted panel, and the Conditioned Genesis on a gold plate specially inscribed. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[91] When he saw these, because he had resolved under former Buddhas and because it was his last birth, he pondered on going forward and turning back, setting the order of the doctrine in his heart and growing uneasy till he came to this conclusion: &amp;lsquo;Now have I seen the likeness of the Exalted One, and have learnt the order of his doctrine at the same time. Full of ill are worldly desires. What have I to do with the life in houses?&amp;rsquo; And he abdicated, entered the Order, and, taking his earthen bowl and followed, as was Prince Pukkusāti, &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by a lamenting populace, he left the town and went to Rājagaha. There he dwelt in the Sabbasoṇḍika Cave, and visited the Exalted One. And learning of him, he won arahantship. Thereupon alluding to his experiences, he uttered this psalm:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.97 Tissa</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.97/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.97/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="197-tissa"&gt;1.97 Tissa&lt;a class="anchor" href="#197-tissa"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī in a brahmin family, he was called Abhaya.

This disturbed his mental composure, so that he returned to the Vihāra thinking: &amp;lsquo;Looking on a visible object has corrupted me. I have done amiss.&amp;rsquo; Thus repudiating that consciousness, he so developed insight as to win arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.98 Abhaya (2)</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.98/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.98/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="198-abhaya-2"&gt;1.98 Abhaya (2)&lt;a class="anchor" href="#198-abhaya-2"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Checking himself by the power of reflection, he [93] entered the Vihāra much agitated, and seating himself for siesta-meditation, he so developed insight that he won arahantship. Thereupon he mentioned his release from the ills of rebirth, through disgust at the corruptions, in this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.99 Uttiya</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.99/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.99/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="199-uttiya"&gt;1.99 Uttiya&lt;a class="anchor" href="#199-uttiya"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Effluent” here is a translation of the term āsava, which stands for three tendencies that “flow out” of the mind and lead to the flood of rebirth: sensuality, becoming, and ignorance. The Jains, contemporaries of the Buddha, also used the term “effluent” in their teachings, but the Buddhist use of the term differed from theirs in two important respects. First, for the Buddhists, effluents were mental, whereas for the Jains they were physical: sticky substances that kept what they regarded as the soul attached to the process of transmigration. Second, for the Jains a living person could become freed of the effluents only at his/her final death. Thus a living person could not be effluent-free. For the Buddhists, however, one became effluent-free at the point of total awakening. Thus a living arahant was effluent-free. Many of the speakers in the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā speak of themselves as effluent-free—see, for instance,Thag 18, Thig 5:11, Thig 14—which means that they are employing the concept in its strictly Buddhist sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.101 Belaṭṭhakāni</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.101-commentary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/commentary/thag1.101-commentary/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="belaṭṭhakāni"&gt;Belaṭṭhakāni&lt;a class="anchor" href="#bela%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adhak%c4%81ni"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Now to render service to his rāja and so show his gratitude for his success, he went to Sīlavatī and preached the Norm to the rāja, declaring to him the Four Truths. The rāja became a convert, built a great Vihāra in the township, calling it Sudassana, and bestowed it on the Thera with many honours and offerings. The latter handed over everything to the Order, and going on his rounds as before, conceived the wish to go to Sāvatthī. The bhikkhus said: &amp;lsquo;Sir, stay with us. If you lack in what you require, we will make it good.&amp;rsquo; He replied: &amp;lsquo;I have no need, friends, of anything out of the way; I keep going on anything I get. I am content with the savour of the Norm,&amp;rsquo; and uttered this psalm:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.103 Bandhura</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.103/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.103/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1103-bandhura"&gt;1.103 Bandhura&lt;a class="anchor" href="#1103-bandhura"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age in a wealthy family at Sāvatthī, he found faith, and entering the Order took an exercise, and joined another bhikkhu, both dwelling in the forest. Not far from where they abode, a doe in the thicket had [99] given birth to a fawn. Tending it, her love kept her from going far from it, and lacking grass and water close by she was famished. Seeing her the Thera said: &amp;lsquo;Ah, surely this world bound in the bonds of craving suffers sore, unable to cut them!&amp;rsquo; And taking this feeling as a goad, he developed insight and won arahantship. Thereupon, discerning that his companion was cherishing many wrong thoughts, he admonished him through the parable of the doe, and uttered this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.109 Saṅgha-Rakkhita</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.109/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.109/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1109-saṅgha-rakkhita"&gt;1.109 Saṅgha-Rakkhita&lt;a class="anchor" href="#1109-sa%e1%b9%85gha-rakkhita"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age in a wealthy family, in the kingdom of Kosala, he found faith in the Master when the latter accepted the gift of the Jeta Grove. Finishing his novitiate, he dwelt in the forest at the foot of the mountain. Now at the time of the rains, the clouds had emptied themselves in the crests of the hills and trees; bushes and creepers became filled with dense foliage. Then the Thera, going forth one day from his cave, saw the loveliness of the woods and the mountains, and considered seriously: &amp;lsquo;These trees and creepers are unconscious, yet by the season&amp;rsquo;s fulfilment they have won growth. Why should not [100] I who have attained a suitable season win growth by good qualities?&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And he uttered this verse, which became his confession of aññā, for he fortnwith strove and won arahantship:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.110 Usabha</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.110/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.110/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1110-usabha"&gt;1.110 Usabha&lt;a class="anchor" href="#1110-usabha"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age as the son of a wealthy brahmin at Rājagaha and named Vaccha, he found faith when King Bimbisāra conferred with the Master. And entering the Order he attained arahantship. As arahant he dwelt in the woods devoted to detachment; hence he came to be called Woodland Vaccha (Vanavaccha). Now it happened that the Thera, in order to do a kindness to his kinsfolk, went to Rājagaha, and dwelt there a little [102] space, telling them of his mode of life. They begged him, saying: &amp;lsquo;Sir, do us the kindness of dwelling in the near Vihāra, and we will wait upon you.&amp;rsquo; The Thera showed them in this verse both his love of the mountains and the life of detachment:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.113 Vanavaccha (2)</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.113/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.113/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1113-vanavaccha-2"&gt;1.113 Vanavaccha (2)&lt;a class="anchor" href="#1113-vanavaccha-2"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

So he went towards Isipatana, exclaiming: &amp;lsquo;Alas! what distress! Alas! what danger!&amp;rsquo; Now at that hour the Exalted One, who was staying at Isipatana in order to do him kindness, was walking to and fro out of doors, and said: &amp;lsquo;Come, Yasa, here is there neither distress nor danger.&amp;rsquo; Yasa filled with joy put off his slippers, and sat down beside the Exalted One.

&lt;p&gt;Reborn in this Buddha-age in the kingdom of Avanti at Veḷugama, &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as the son of a caravan guide, he became (by correspondence) the unseen friend of Citta, a house-father at Macchikasaṇḍa. The latter wrote to him on the excellence of the Buddha, and sent him a copy of the system. This so moved him that he sought ordination under the Thera Kaccāna the Great. In due course he acquired sixfold abhiññā. Thereupon he had a mind to visit the Buddha, and taking leave of the Thera, came in course of time to the Middle Country, &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and had an interview with the Master. The latter asked him the question, &amp;lsquo;How goes [108] it with you, bhikkhu? Are you prospering?&amp;rsquo; And he replied: &amp;lsquo;Exalted One, from the time when I was admitted into your Rule, all sorrow and pain left me, all sense of peril was calmed.&amp;rsquo; And he declared aññā in making that confession, uttering this verse:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.120 Isidatta</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.120/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/davids/chapter-one/thag1.120/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1120-isidatta"&gt;1.120 Isidatta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#1120-isidatta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factors of my life well understood&lt;br&gt;
Stand yet a little while with severed root.&lt;br&gt;
Sorrow is slain! that quest I&amp;rsquo;ve won, and won&lt;br&gt;
Is purity from fourfold Venom&amp;rsquo;s stain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Verse 120</title><link>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.120/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theragatha.github.io/en/theragatha/thanissaro/chapter-one/thag1.120/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1120-isidatta"&gt;1.120 Isidatta&lt;a class="anchor" href="#1120-isidatta"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five aggregates,&lt;br&gt;
having been comprehended,&lt;br&gt;
stand with their root&lt;br&gt;
cut through.&lt;br&gt;
For me&lt;br&gt;
the ending of stress&lt;br&gt;
is reached;&lt;br&gt;
the ending of effluents,&lt;br&gt;
attained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little hut is roofed and pleasant,&lt;br&gt;
Sheltered from the wind:&lt;br&gt;
So rain, sky, as you please!&lt;br&gt;
My mind is serene and freed,&lt;br&gt;
I practice whole-heartedly: so rain, sky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="12-mahākoṭṭhika"&gt;&lt;a href="../thag1.2/"&gt;1.2 Mahākoṭṭhika&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#12-mah%c4%81ko%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adhika"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calm and quiet,&lt;br&gt;
Wise in counsel and steady;&lt;br&gt;
Shaking off bad qualities,&lt;br&gt;
As the wind shakes leaves off a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See this wisdom of the Tathāgatas!&lt;br&gt;
Like a fire blazing in the night,&lt;br&gt;
Giving light, giving vision,&lt;br&gt;
Dispelling the doubt of those who’ve come here.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
